These operators accept any value of\nthe Number type but first convert each such value to one of 2<sup>32</sup> integer values.\"\n\nIn some use cases, however, it is required to be able to reliably work with and perform bitwise operations on the full\n64 bits. This is where long.js comes into play.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe package exports an ECMAScript module with an UMD fallback.\n\n```\n$> npm install long\n```\n\n```js\nimport Long from \"long\";\n\nvar value = new Long(0xFFFFFFFF, 0x7FFFFFFF);\nconsole.log(value.toString());\n...\n```\n\nNote that mixing ESM and CommonJS is not recommended as it yields different classes, albeit with the same functionality.\n\n### Usage with a CDN\n\n  * From GitHub via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com):<br />\n    `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dcodeIO/long.js@TAG/index.js` (ESM)\n  * From npm via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com):<br />\n    `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/long@VERSION/index.js` (ESM)<br />\n    `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/long@VERSION/umd/index.js` (UMD)\n  * From npm via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):<br />\n    `https://unpkg.com/long@VERSION/index.js` (ESM)<br />\n    `https://unpkg.com/long@VERSION/umd/index.js` (UMD)\n\n  Replace `TAG` respectively `VERSION` with a [specific version](https://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js/releases) or omit it (not recommended in production) to use main/latest.\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### Constructor\n\n* new **Long**(low: `number`, high?: `number`, unsigned?: `boolean`)<br />\n  Constructs a 64 bit two's-complement integer, given its low and high 32 bit values as *signed* integers.

arithmetic out of the box, hence a [tiny WebAssembly module](./wasm.wat) is used to compute operations like multiplication, division and remainder more efficiently (slow operations like division are around twice as fast), falling back to floating point based computations in JavaScript where WebAssembly is not yet supported, e.g., in older versions of node.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\nBuilding the UMD fallback:\n\n```\n$> npm run build\n```\n\nRunning the [tests](./tests):\n\n```\n$> npm test\n```\n",
