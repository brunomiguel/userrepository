It\n works well in node and has cursory browser (more below) support. It contains a\n number of options to configure how the hex dump will end up looking.\n \n It should create a pleasant looking hex dumb by default:\n     \n     var hexy = require('hexy'),\n            b = new Buffer(\"\\000\\001\\003\\005\\037\\012\\011bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789\")\n             // or String or Array containing numbers ( bytes, i.e. < 0xFF )\n     \n     console.log(hexy.hexy(b))\n \n results in this dump:\n \n     00000000: 0001 0305 1f0a 0962 6364 6566 6768 696a  .......bcdefghij\n     00000010: 6b6c 6d6e 6f70 7172 7374 7576 7778 797a  klmnopqrstuvwxyz\n     00000020: 3031 3233 3435 3637 3839                 0123456789\n \n but it's also possible to configure:\n \n   * Line numbering\n   * Line width\n   * Format of byte grouping\n   * Case of hex decimals\n   * Presence of the ASCII annotation in the right column.\n \n This means it's easy to generate exciting dumps like:\n \n     0000000: 0001 0305 1f0a 0962  .... ...b \n     0000008: 6364 6566 6768 696a  cdef ghij \n     0000010: 6b6c 6d6e 6f70 7172  klmn opqr \n     0000018: 7374 7576 7778 797a  stuv wxyz \n     0000020: 3031 3233 3435 3637  0123 4567 \n     0000028: 3839                 89\n \n or even:\n \n     0000000: 00 01 03 05 1f 0a 09 62   63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6a \n     0000010: 6b 6c 6d 6e 6f 70 71 72   73 74 75 76 77 78 79 7a \n     0000020: 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37   38 39\n \n with hexy!\n \n ## Accepted Input\n \n Currently, input should be one of the following:\n \n   - a `Buffer`\n   - a `String`\n   - an `Array` containing `Number`s. These should fit into\n     8 bits, i.e. be smaller than 255. Larger values are truncated\n     (specifically `val & 0xff`)\n \n ## Formatting Options\n \n Formatting options are configured by passing a `format` object to the `hexy` function:\n \n     var format = {}\n         format.width = width // how many bytes per line, default 16\n         format.numbering = n // [\"hex_bytes\" | \"none\"],  default \"hex_bytes\"\n         format.format = f    // [\"eights\"|\"fours\"|\"twos\"|\"none\"], how many nibbles per group\n                              //                          default \"fours\"\n         format.caps = c      // [\"lower\"|\"upper\"],       default lower\n         format.annotate=a    // [\"ascii\"|\"none\"], ascii annotation at end of line?\n                              //                          default \"ascii\"\n         format.prefix=p      // <string> something pretty to put in front of each line\n                              //                          default \"\"\n         format.indent=i      // <num> number of spaces to indent\n                              //                          default 0\n         format.html=true     // funky html divs 'n stuff! experimental.\n                              //                          default: false\n         format.offset = X    // generate hexdump based on X byte offset\n                              // into the provided source\n                              //                          default 0\n         format.length = Y    // process Y bytes of the provide source \n                              // starting at `offset`. -1 for all\n                              //                          default -1\n         format.display_offset = Z\n                              // add Z to the address prepended to each line\n                              // (note, even if `offset` is provided, addressing\n                              // is started at 0)\n                                                          dafault 0                         \n \n     console.log(hexy.hexy(buffer, format))\n \n In case you're really nerdy, you'll have noticed that the defaults correspond\n to how `xxd` formats it's output.\n            \n \n ## Installing\n \n Either use `npm` (or whatever caompatible npm thingie people are using\n these days) :\n   \n     npm install hexy\n \n This will install the lib which you'll be able to use like so:\n     \n     var hexy = require(\"hexy\"),\n         buf  = // get Buffer from somewhere,\n         str  = hexy.hexy(buf)\n \n It will also install `hexy` into your path in case you're totally fed up\n with using `xxd`.\n         \n  \n If you don't like `npm`, grab the source from github:\n \n     http://github.com/a2800276/hexy.js\n \n ## Browser Support\n \n Basically eveything should work fine in the browser as well, just\n include hexy.js in a script tag, and you'll get `hexy` and `Hexy` stuck\n to the global object (window).\n \n Some caveats: \"Works fine on my systemâ„¢\". Browser support is 'new' and\n not thoroughly tested (... eh, only on chrome [Version: whatever I'm\n currently running]). Under node, I can generally assume that binary data\n is passed in in a sane fashion using buffers, but plain old Javascript\n doesn't really have any datatypes that can handle bytes gracefully.\n Currently only Strings and arrays containing Number'ish values are\n supported, I'd like to add numeric and typed arrays more explicitly.\n \n Let me know in case you run into any issues, I'd be happy to find out\n about them.\n \n ## TODOS\n \n The current version only pretty prints node.js Buffers, and JS Strings\n and Arrays. This should be expanded to also do typed arrays,\n Streams/series of Buffers which would be nice so you don't have to\n collect the whole things you want to pretty print in memory, and such.\n \n I'd like to improve html rendering, e.g. to be able to mouse over the\n ascii annotation and highlight the hex byte and vice versa, improve\n browser integration and set up a proper build & packaging system.\n\n Thinking about perhaps supporting typescript ...\n \n Better testing for browser use.\n \n  \n ## Thanks\n \n * Thanks to Isaac Schlueter [isaacs] for gratiously lending a hand and\n cheering me up.\n * dodo (http://coderwall.com/dodo)\n * the fine folks at [Travis](http://travis-ci.org/a2800276/hexy.js)\n * radare (https://github.com/radare)\n * Michele Caini (https://github.com/skypjack)\n * Koen Houtman (https://github.com/automagisch)\n * Stef Levesque (https://github.com/stef-levesque)\n \n ## History\n \n This is a fairly straightforward port of `hexy.rb` which does more or less the\n same thing. You can find it here: \n  \n     http://github.com/a2800276/hexy\n  \n in case these sorts of things interest you.\n \n ## Mail\n \n In case you discover bugs, spelling errors, offer suggestions for\n improvements or would like to help out with the project, you can contact\n me directly (tim@kuriositaet.de). \n\n",
