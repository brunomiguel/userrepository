All metadata properties\n```\n\n#### Access specific properties\n```js\nconst data = await gcpMetadata.instance('hostname');\nconsole.log(data); // ...Instance hostname\nconst projectId = await gcpMetadata.project('project-id');\nconsole.log(projectId); // ...Project ID of the running instance\n```\n\n#### Access nested properties with the relative path\n```js\nconst data = await gcpMetadata.instance('service-accounts/default/email');\nconsole.log(data); // ...Email address of the Compute identity service account\n```\n\n#### Access specific properties with query parameters\n```js\nconst data = await gcpMetadata.instance({\n  property: 'tags',\n  params: { alt: 'text' }\n});\nconsole.log(data) // ...Tags as newline-delimited list\n```\n\n#### Access with custom headers\n```js\nawait gcpMetadata.instance({\n  headers: { 'no-trace': '1' }\n}); // ...Request is untraced\n```\n\n### Take care with large number valued properties\n\nIn some cases number valued properties returned by the Metadata Service may be\ntoo large to be representable as JavaScript numbers. In such cases we return\nthose values as `BigNumber` objects (from the [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js) library). Numbers\nthat fit within the JavaScript number range will be returned as normal number\nvalues.\n\n```js\nconst id = await gcpMetadata.instance('id');\nconsole.log(id)  // ... BigNumber { s: 1, e: 18, c: [ 45200, 31799277581759 ] }\nconsole.log(id.toString()) // ... 4520031799277581759\n```\n\n### Environment variables\n\n* GCE_METADATA_HOST: provide an alternate host or IP to perform lookup against (useful, for example, you're connecting through a custom proxy server).\n\nFor example:\n```\nexport GCE_METADATA_HOST = '169.254.169.254'\n```\n\n* DETECT_GCP_RETRIES: number representing number of retries that should be attempted on metadata lookup.\n\n\n## Samples\n\nSamples are in the [`samples/`](https://github.com/googleapis/gcp-metadata/tree/main/samples) directory. Each sample's `README.md` has instructions for running its sample.\n\n| Sample                      | Source Code                       | Try it |\n| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |\n| Quickstart | [source code](https://github.com/googleapis/gcp-metadata/blob/main/samples/quickstart.js) | [![Open in Cloud Shell][shell_img]](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/googleapis/gcp-metadata&page=editor&open_in_editor=samples/quickstart.js,samples/README.md) |\n\n\n\nThe [GCP Metadata Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation\nalso contains samples.\n\n## Supported Node.js Versions\n\nOur client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).\nLibraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of\nNode.js.\nIf you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update\nas soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.\n\nGoogle's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a\nbest-efforts basis with the following warnings:\n\n* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.\n* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.\n* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.\n\nClient libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and\ncan be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).\nThe dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.\nFor example, `npm install gcp-metadata@legacy-8` installs client libraries\nfor versions compatible with Node.js 8.\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\n\nThis library is considered to be **General Availability (GA)**. This means it\nis stable; the code surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways\nunless absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with\nan extensive deprecation period. Issues and requests against **GA** libraries\nare addressed with the highest priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information: [Google Cloud Platform Launch Stages][launch_stages]\n\n[launch_stages]: https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome! See the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/googleapis/gcp-metadata/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nPlease note that this `README.md`, the `samples/README.md`,\nand a variety of configuration files in this repository (including `.nycrc` and `tsconfig.json`)\nare generated from a central template.
