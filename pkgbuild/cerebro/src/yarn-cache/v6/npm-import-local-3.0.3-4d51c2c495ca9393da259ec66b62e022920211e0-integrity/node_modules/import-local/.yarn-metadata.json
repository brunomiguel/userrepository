For example, [AVA](https://avajs.dev) and [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) uses this method.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install import-local\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst importLocal = require('import-local');\n\nif (importLocal(__filename)) {\n\tconsole.log('Using local version of this package');\n} else {\n\t// Code for both global and local version here…\n}\n```\n\n\n---\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\t<b>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-import-local?utm_source=npm-import-local&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme\">Get professional support for this package with a Tidelift subscription</a>\n\t</b>\n\t<br>\n\t<sub>\n\t\tTidelift helps make open source sustainable for maintainers while giving companies<br>assurances about security, maintenance, and licensing for their dependencies.\n\t</sub>\n</div>\n",
