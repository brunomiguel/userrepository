It reads GIFs into an internal representation that's easy to work with and allows for making GIFs from scratch. The frame class is structured to make it easy to move images between [`Jimp`](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp) and `gifwrap` for more sophisticated image manipulation in `Jimp`, but the module has no dependency on `Jimp`.\n\nThe library uses Dean McNamee's [`omggif`](https://github.com/deanm/omggif) GIF encoder/decoder by default, but it employs an abstraction that allows using other encoders and decoders as well, once suitably wrapped.\n\nAt present, the module only works in Node.js. Includes Typescript typings.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install gifwrap --save\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nyarn add gifwrap\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can work with either GIF files or GIF encodings, and you can create GIFs from scratch.\n\nThe GifFrame class represents a single image frame, and the library largely represents a GIF as an array of GifFrame instances. For example, here is how you create a GIF from scratch:\n\n```js\nconst { GifFrame, GifUtil, GifCodec } = require('gifwrap');\nconst width = 200, height = 100;\nconst frames = [];\n\nlet frame = new GifFrame(width, height, { delayCentisecs: 10 });\n// modify the pixels at frame.bitmap.data\nframes.push(frame);\nframe = new GifFrame(width, height, { delayCentisecs: 15 });\n// modify the pixels at frame.bitmap.data\nframes.push(frame);\n// add more frames as desired...\n\n// to write to a file...\nGifUtil.write(\"my-creation.gif\", frames, { loops: 3 }).then(gif => {\n    console.log(\"written\");\n});\n\n// to get the byte encoding without writing to a file...\nconst codec = new GifCodec();\ncodec.encodeGif(frames, { loops: 3 }).then(gif => {\n    // byte encoding is now in gif.buffer\n});\n\n```\n\nImages are represented within a GifFrame exactly as they are in a `Jimp` image. In particular, each GifFrame instance has a `bitmap` property having the following structure:\n\n* `frame.bitmap.width` - Width of image in pixels\n* `frame.bitmap.height` - Height of image in pixels\n* `frame.bitmap.data` - A Node.js Buffer that can be accessed like an array of bytes. Every 4 adjacent bytes represents the RGBA values of a single pixel. These 4 bytes correspond to red, green, blue, and alpha, in that order. Each pixel begins at an index that is a multiple of 4.\n\nGIFs do not support partial transparency, so within `frame.bitmap.data`, pixels having alpha value 0x00 are treated as transparent and pixels of non-zero alpha value are treated as opaque. The encoder ignores the RGB values of transparent pixels.\n\n`gifwrap` also provides utilities for reading GIF files and for parsing raw encodings:\n\n```js\nconst { GifUtil } = require('gifwrap');\nGifUtil.read(\"fancy.gif\").then(inputGif => {\n\n    inputGif.frames.foreach(frame => {\n\n        const buf = frame.bitmap.data;\n        frame.scanAllCoords((x, y, bi) => {\n\n            // Halve all grays on right half of image.\n\n            if (x > inputGif.width / 2) {\n                const r = buf[bi];\n                const g = buf[bi + 1];\n                const b = buf[bi + 2];\n                const a = buf[bi + 3];\n                if (r === g && r === b && a === 0xFF) {\n                    buf[bi] /= 2;\n                    buf[bi + 1] /= 2;\n                    buf[bi + 2] /= 2;\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    });\n\n    // Pass inputGif to write() to preserve the original GIF's specs.\n    return GifUtil.write(\"modified.gif\", inputGif.frames, inputGif).then(outputGif => {\n        console.log(\"modified\");\n    });\n});\n```\n\n```js\nconst { GifUtil, GifCodec } = require('gifwrap');\nconst codec = new GifCodec();\nconst byteEncodingBuffer = getByteEncodingForSomeGif();\n\ncodec.decodeGif(byteEncodingBuffer).then(sourceGif => {\n\n    const edgeLength = Math.min(sourceGif.width, sourceGif.height);\n    sourceGif.frames.forEach(frame => {\n\n        // Make each frame a centered square of size edgeLength x edgeLength.\n        // Note that frames may vary in size and that reframe() works even if\n        // the frame's image is smaller than the square. Should this happen,\n        // the space surrounding the original image will be transparent.\n\n        const xOffset = (frame.bitmap.width - edgeLength)/2;\n        const yOffset = (frame.bitmap.height - edgeLength)/2;\n        frame.reframe(xOffset, yOffset, edgeLength, edgeLength);\n    });\n\n    // The encoder determines GIF size from the frames, not the provided spec (sourceGif).\n    return GifUtil.write(\"modified.gif\", sourceGif.frames, sourceGif).then(outputGif => {\n        console.log(\"modified\");\n    });\n});\n```\n\nNotice that both encoding and decoding yields a GIF object. This is an instance of class Gif, and it provides information about the GIF, such as its size and how many times it loops. Notice also that you never call the Gif constructor to create a GIF. Instead, GIFs are created by providing a GifFrame array and a specification of GIF options. That specification is a subset of the properties of a Gif, so you can pass a previously-loaded Gif as a specification when writing or encoding. The encoder only uses the properties that can't be inferred from the frames -- namely, how many times the GIF loops and how to attempt to package the color tables within the encoding.\n\n## Leveraging Jimp\n\nThis module was originally written as a wrapper around Jimp images -- hence its name -- and then with frames as subclasses of Jimp images. Neither approach worked out well. The final approach requires just a tad of legwork to use `gifwrap` images within Jimp.\n\nBoth Jimp images and GifFrame instances share the `bitmap` property. By transferring this property back and forth between Jimp images and GifFrame instances, an image can be moved back and forth between the two libraries.\n\nYou can construct a GifFrame from a Jimp image as follows:\n\n```js\nconst { BitmapImage, GifFrame } = require('gifwrap');\nconst Jimp = require('jimp');\nconst j = new Jimp(200, 100, 0xFFFFFFFF);\n\n// create a frame clone of a Jip bitmap\nconst fCopied = new GifFrame(new BitmapImage(j));\n\n// create a frame that shares a bitmap with Jimp (one way)\nconst fShared1 = new GifFrame(j);\n\n// create a frame that shares a bitmap with Jimp (another way)\nconst fShared2 = new GifFrame(1, 1, 0); // any GifFrame\nfShared2.bitmap = j.bitmap;\n```\n\nAnd you can construct a Jimp instance from a GifFrame image as follows:\n\n```js\nconst { BitmapImage, GifFrame } = require('gifwrap');\nconst Jimp = require('jimp');\nconst frame = new GifFrame(200, 100, 0xFFFFFFFF);\n\n// create a Jimp containing a clone of the frame bitmap\njimpCopied = GifUtil.copyAsJimp(Jimp, frame);\n\n// create a Jimp that shares a bitmap with the frame\njimpShared = GifUtil.shareAsJimp(Jimp, frame);\n```\n\n## Encoders and Decoders\n\n`gifwrap` provides a default GIF encoder/decoder, but it is architected to be able to work with other encoders and decoders. The encoder and decoder may even be separate implementations. Encoders and decoders have varying capabilities, performance measures, and levels of reliability.\n\nGifCodec is the default implementation, and it's both an encoder and a decoder. It's an adapter that wraps the [`omggif`](https://github.com/deanm/omggif) module. `omggif` appears to support a broad variety of GIFs, although it cannot produce an interlaced encoding (which there is little need for anyway). Although `omggif` doesn't include a test suite at present, `gifwrap`'s test suite happens to test it reasonably well by virtue of using `omggif` underneath.\n\nAn encoder need only implement GifCodec's [`encodeGif()`](#GifCodec+encodeGif) method, and a decoder need only implement its [`decodeGif()`](#GifCodec+decodeGif) method. See the descriptions of those methods for the requirement details. Although GifCodec is stateless, so that instances an be reused across multiple encodings and decodings, third party encoders and decoders need not be. However, applications that use the library with stateful encoders will need to be aware of the need to create new instances.\n\nTo use a third-party encoder or decoder with the GifUtil `write()` and `read()` functions, just pass an instance of the encoder or decoder as the last parameter to `write()` or `read()`, respectively. For example:\n\n```js\nconst { GifUtil } = require('gifwrap');\nconst SnazzyDecoder = require('gifwrap-snazzy-decoder');\nconst AwesomeEncoder = require('gifwrap-awesome-encoder');\n\nGifUtil.read(\"fancy.gif\", new SnazzyDecoder()).then(gif =>\n\n    /*...*/\n\n    return GifUtil.write(\"modified.gif\", gif.frames, gif, new AwesomeEncoder()).then(newGif => {\n        console.log(\"modified\");\n    });\n});\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\nThe [Typescript typings](https://github.com/jtlapp/gifwrap/blob/master/index.d.ts) provide an exact specification of the API and also serve as a cheat sheet.

It's shape is borrowed from the Jimp package to make it easy to transfer GIF image frames into Jimp and Jimp images into GIF image frames. Each instance has a `bitmap` property having the following properties:\n\nProperty | Description\n--- | ---\nbitmap.width | width of image in pixels\nbitmap.height | height of image in pixels\nbitmap.data | a Buffer whose every four bytes represents a pixel, each sequential byte of a pixel corresponding to the red, green, blue, and alpha values of the pixel\n\nIts constructor supports the following signatures:\n\n* new BitmapImage(bitmap: { width: number, height: number, data: Buffer })\n* new BitmapImage(bitmapImage: BitmapImage)\n* new BitmapImage(width: number, height: number, buffer: Buffer)\n* new BitmapImage(width: number, height: number, backgroundRGBA?: number)\n\nWhen a `BitmapImage` is provided, the constructed `BitmapImage` is a deep clone of the provided one, so that each image's pixel data can subsequently be modified without affecting each other.\n\n`backgroundRGBA` is an optional parameter representing a pixel as a single number. In hex, the number is as follows: 0xRRGGBBAA, where RR is the red byte, GG the green byte, BB, the blue byte, and AA the alpha value. An AA of 0x00 is considered transparent, and all non-zero AA values are treated as opaque.\n\n<a name=\"BitmapImage+blit\"></a>\n\n### *bitmapImage*.blit(toImage, toX, toY, fromX, fromY)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| toImage | [<code>BitmapImage</code>](#BitmapImage) | Image into which to copy the square |\n| toX | <code>number</code> | x-coord in toImage of upper-left corner of receiving square |\n| toY | <code>number</code> | y-coord in toImage of upper-left corner of receiving square |\n| fromX | <code>number</code> | x-coord in this image of upper-left corner of source square |\n| fromY | <code>number</code> | y-coord in this image of upper-left corner of source square |\n\nCopy a square portion of this image into another image.\n\n**Returns**: [<code>BitmapImage</code>](#BitmapImage) - The present image to allow for chaining.  \n<a name=\"BitmapImage+fillRGBA\"></a>\n\n### *bitmapImage*.fillRGBA(rgba)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| rgba | <code>number</code> | Color with which to fill image, expressed as a singlenumber in the form 0xRRGGBBAA, where AA is 0x00 for transparent and any other value for opaque. |\n\nFills the image with a single color.\n\n**Returns**: [<code>BitmapImage</code>](#BitmapImage) - The present image to allow for chaining.  \n<a name=\"BitmapImage+getRGBA\"></a>\n\n### *bitmapImage*.getRGBA(x, y)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| x | <code>number</code> | x-coord of pixel |\n| y | <code>number</code> | y-coord of pixel |\n\nGets the RGBA number of the pixel at the given coordinate in the form 0xRRGGBBAA, where AA is the alpha value, with alpha 0x00 encoding to transparency in GIFs.\n\n**Returns**: <code>number</code> - RGBA of pixel in 0xRRGGBBAA form  \n<a name=\"BitmapImage+getRGBASet\"></a>\n\n### *bitmapImage*.getRGBASet()\nGets a set of all RGBA colors found within the image.\n\n**Returns**: <code>Set</code> - Set of all RGBA colors that the image contains.  \n<a name=\"BitmapImage+greyscale\"></a>\n\n### *bitmapImage*.greyscale()\nConverts the image to greyscale using inferred Adobe metrics.\n\n**Returns**: [<code>BitmapImage</code>](#BitmapImage) - The present image to allow for chaining.  \n<a name=\"BitmapImage+reframe\"></a>\n\n### *bitmapImage*.reframe(xOffset, yOffset, width, height, fillRGBA)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| xOffset | <code>number</code> | The x-coord offset of the upper-left pixel of the desired image relative to the present image. |\n| yOffset | <code>number</code> | The y-coord offset of the upper-left pixel of the desired image relative to the present image. |\n| width | <code>number</code> | The width of the new image after reframing |\n| height | <code>number</code> | The height of the new image after reframing |\n| fillRGBA | <code>number</code> | The color with which to fill space added to the image as a result of the reframing, in 0xRRGGBBAA format, where AA is 0x00 to indicate transparent and a non-zero value to indicate opaque. This parameter is only required when the reframing exceeds the original boundaries (i.e. does not simply perform a crop). |\n\nReframes the image as if placing a frame around the original image and replacing the original image with the newly framed image. When the new frame is strictly within the boundaries of the original image, this method crops the image. When any of the new boundaries exceed those of the original image, the `fillRGBA` must be provided to indicate the color with which to fill the extra space added to the image.\n\n**Returns**: [<code>BitmapImage</code>](#BitmapImage) - The present image to allow for chaining.  \n<a name=\"BitmapImage+scale\"></a>\n\n### *bitmapImage*.scale(factor)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| factor | <code>number</code> | The factor by which to scale up the image.

Each property within option is itself optional.\n\nProvide a `frame` to the constructor to create a clone of the provided frame. The new frame includes a copy of the provided frame's pixel data so that each can subsequently be modified without affecting each other.\n\n<a name=\"GifFrame+getPalette\"></a>\n\n### *gifFrame*.getPalette()\nGet a summary of the colors found within the frame. The return value is an object of the following form:\n\nProperty | Description\n--- | ---\ncolors | An array of all the opaque colors found within the frame. Each color is given as an RGB number of the form 0xRRGGBB. The array is sorted by increasing number. Will be an empty array when the image is completely transparent.\nusesTransparency | boolean indicating whether there are any transparent pixels within the frame. A pixel is considered transparent if its alpha value is 0x00.\nindexCount | The number of color indexes required to represent this palette of colors.

The method is able to return an array of all colors found across all frames.\n\n`maxGlobalIndex` controls whether the computation short-circuits to avoid doing work that the caller doesn't need. The method only returns `colors` and `indexCount` for the colors across all frames when the number of indexes required to store the colors and transparency in a GIF (which is the value of `indexCount`) is less than or equal to `maxGlobalIndex`. Such short-circuiting is useful when the caller just needs to determine whether any frame includes transparency.\n\n**Returns**: <code>object</code> - Object containing at least `palettes` and `usesTransparency`. `palettes` is an array of all the palettes returned by GifFrame#getPalette(). `usesTransparency` indicates whether at least one frame uses transparency.

The properties are as followings, imported from the [`image-q` package](https://github.com/ibezkrovnyi/image-quantization) without explanation: { `ditherAlgorithm`: One of 'FloydSteinberg', 'FalseFloydSteinberg', 'Stucki', 'Atkinson', 'Jarvis', 'Burkes', 'Sierra', 'TwoSierra', 'SierraLite'; `minimumColorDistanceToDither`: (optional) A number defaulting to 0; `serpentine`: (optional) A boolean defaulting to true; `calculateErrorLikeGIMP`: (optional) A boolean defaulting to false. } |\n\nQuantizes colors so that there are at most a given number of color indexes (including transparency) across all provided images. Uses an algorithm by Anthony Dekker.\n\nThe method treats different RGBA combinations as different colors, so if the frame has multiple alpha values or multiple RGB values for an alpha value, the caller may first want to normalize them by converting all transparent pixels to the same RGBA values.\n\nThe method may increase the number of colors if there are fewer than the provided maximum.\n\n<a name=\"GifUtil.quantizeSorokin\"></a>\n\n### *GifUtil*.quantizeSorokin(imageOrImages, maxColorIndexes, histogram, dither)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| imageOrImages | [<code>BitmapImage</code>](#BitmapImage) \\| [<code>Array.&lt;BitmapImage&gt;</code>](#BitmapImage) | Image or array of images (such as GifFrame instances) to be color-quantized. Quantizing across multiple images ensures color consistency from frame to frame. |\n| maxColorIndexes | <code>number</code> | The maximum number of color indexes that will exist in the palette after completing quantization. Defaults to 256. |\n| histogram | <code>string</code> | (optional) Histogram method: 'top-pop' for global top-population, 'min-pop' for minimum-population threshhold within subregions. Defaults to 'min-pop'. |\n| dither | <code>object</code> | (optional) An object configuring the dithering to apply, as explained for `quantizeDekker()`. |\n\nQuantizes colors so that there are at most a given number of color indexes (including transparency) across all provided images. Uses an algorithm by Leon Sorokin. This quantization method differs from the other two by likely never increasing the number of colors, should there be fewer than the provided maximum.\n\nThe method treats different RGBA combinations as different colors, so if the frame has multiple alpha values or multiple RGB values for an alpha value, the caller may first want to normalize them by converting all transparent pixels to the same RGBA values.\n\n<a name=\"GifUtil.quantizeWu\"></a>\n\n### *GifUtil*.quantizeWu(imageOrImages, maxColorIndexes, significantBits, dither)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| imageOrImages | [<code>BitmapImage</code>](#BitmapImage) \\| [<code>Array.&lt;BitmapImage&gt;</code>](#BitmapImage) | Image or array of images (such as GifFrame instances) to be color-quantized. Quantizing across multiple images ensures color consistency from frame to frame. |\n| maxColorIndexes | <code>number</code> | The maximum number of color indexes that will exist in the palette after completing quantization. Defaults to 256. |\n| significantBits | <code>number</code> | (optional) This is the number of significant high bits in each RGB color channel. Takes integer values from 1 through 8. Higher values correspond to higher quality. Defaults to 5. |\n| dither | <code>object</code> | (optional) An object configuring the dithering to apply, as explained for `quantizeDekker()`. |\n\nQuantizes colors so that there are at most a given number of color indexes (including transparency) across all provided images. Uses an algorithm by Xiaolin Wu.\n\nThe method treats different RGBA combinations as different colors, so if the frame has multiple alpha values or multiple RGB values for an alpha value, the caller may first want to normalize them by converting all transparent pixels to the same RGBA values.\n\nThe method may increase the number of colors if there are fewer than the provided maximum.\n\n<a name=\"GifUtil.read\"></a>\n\n### *GifUtil*.read(source, decoder)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| source | <code>string</code> \\| <code>Buffer</code> | Source to decode. When a string, it's the GIF filename to load and parse. When a Buffer, it's an encoded GIF to parse. |\n| decoder | <code>object</code> | An optional GIF decoder object implementing the `decode` method of class GifCodec. When provided, the method decodes the GIF using this decoder. When not provided, the method uses GifCodec. |\n\nread() decodes an encoded GIF, whether provided as a filename or as a byte buffer.\n\n**Returns**: <code>Promise</code> - A Promise that resolves to an instance of the Gif class, representing the decoded GIF.  \n<a name=\"GifUtil.shareAsJimp\"></a>\n\n### *GifUtil*.shareAsJimp(Reference, Instance)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reference | <code>object</code> | to the Jimp package, keeping this library from being dependent on Jimp. |\n| Instance | <code>bitmapImageToShare</code> | of BitmapImage (may be a GifUtil) with which to source the Jimp. |\n\nshareAsJimp() returns a Jimp that shares a bitmap with the provided bitmap image (which may be either a BitmapImage or a GifFrame). Modifying the image in either the Jimp or the BitmapImage affects the other objects. This method serves as a macro for simplifying working with Jimp.\n\n**Returns**: <code>object</code> - An new instance of Jimp that shares the image in bitmapImageToShare.  \n<a name=\"GifUtil.write\"></a>\n\n### *GifUtil*.write(path, frames, spec, encoder)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| path | <code>string</code> | Filename to write GIF out as. Will overwrite an existing file. |\n| frames | [<code>Array.&lt;GifFrame&gt;</code>](#GifFrame) | Array of frames to be written into GIF. |\n| spec | <code>object</code> | An optional object that may provide values for `loops` and `colorScope`, as defined for the Gif class. However, `colorSpace` may also take the value Gif.GlobalColorsPreferred (== 0) to indicate that the encoder should attempt to create only a global color table. `loop` defaults to 0, looping indefinitely, and `colorScope` defaults to Gif.GlobalColorsPreferred. |\n| encoder | <code>object</code> | An optional GIF encoder object implementing the `encode` method of class GifCodec. When provided, the method encodes the GIF using this encoder. When not provided, the method uses GifCodec. |\n\nwrite() encodes a GIF and saves it as a file.\n\n**Returns**: <code>Promise</code> - A Promise that resolves to an instance of the Gif class, representing the encoded GIF.  \n<a name=\"new_GifCodec_new\"></a>\n\n### new GifCodec(options)\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| options | <code>object</code> | Optionally takes an objection whose only possible property is `transparentRGB`. Images are internally represented in RGBA format, where A is the alpha value of a pixel. When `transparentRGB` is provided, this RGB value (excluding alpha) is assigned to transparent pixels, which are also given alpha value 0x00. (All opaque pixels are given alpha value 0xFF). The RGB color of transparent pixels shouldn't matter for most applications. Defaults to 0x000000. |\n\nGifCodec is a class that both encodes and decodes GIFs. It implements both the `encode()` method expected of an encoder and the `decode()` method expected of a decoder, and it wraps the `omggif` GIF encoder/decoder package. GifCodec serves as this library's default encoder and decoder, but it's possible to wrap other GIF encoders and decoders for use by `gifwrap` as well. GifCodec will not encode GIFs with interlacing.\n\nInstances of this class are stateless and can be shared across multiple encodings and decodings.\n\nIts constructor takes one option argument:\n\n<a name=\"GifCodec+decodeGif\"></a>\n\n### *gifCodec*.decodeGif(buffer)\n**Throws**:\n\n- [<code>GifError</code>](#GifError) Error upon encountered an encoding-related problem with a GIF, so that the caller can distinguish between software errors and problems with GIFs.\n\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| buffer | <code>Buffer</code> | Bytes of an encoded GIF to decode. |\n\nDecodes a GIF from a Buffer to yield an instance of Gif. Transparent pixels of the GIF are given alpha values of 0x00, and opaque pixels are given alpha values of 0xFF. The RGB values of transparent pixels default to 0x000000 but can be overridden by the constructor's `transparentRGB` option.\n\n**Returns**: <code>Promise</code> - A Promise that resolves to an instance of the Gif class, representing the encoded GIF.  \n<a name=\"GifCodec+encodeGif\"></a>\n\n### *gifCodec*.encodeGif(frames, spec)\n**Throws**:\n\n- [<code>GifError</code>](#GifError) Error upon encountered an encoding-related problem with a GIF, so that the caller can distinguish between software errors and problems with GIFs.\n\n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| frames | [<code>Array.&lt;GifFrame&gt;</code>](#GifFrame) | Array of frames to encode |\n| spec | <code>object</code> | An optional object that may provide values for `loops` and `colorScope`, as defined for the Gif class. However, `colorSpace` may also take the value Gif.GlobalColorsPreferred (== 0) to indicate that the encoder should attempt to create only a global color table. `loop` defaults to 0, looping indefinitely, and `colorScope` defaults to Gif.GlobalColorsPreferred. |\n\nEncodes a GIF from provided frames. Each pixel having an alpha value of 0x00 renders as transparent within the encoding, while all pixels of non-zero alpha value render as opaque.\n\n**Returns**: <code>Promise</code> - A Promise that resolves to an instance of the Gif class, representing the encoded GIF.  \n<a name=\"new_GifError_new\"></a>\n\n### new GifError(messageOrError)\n\n| Param | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| messageOrError | <code>string</code> \\| <code>Error</code> | \n\nGifError is a class representing a GIF-related error\n\n\n## LICENSE\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright © 2017 Joseph T.
