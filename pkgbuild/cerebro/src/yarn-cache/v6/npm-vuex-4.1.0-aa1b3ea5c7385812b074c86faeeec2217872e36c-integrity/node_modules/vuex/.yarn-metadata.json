Pinia has almost the exact same or enhanced API as Vuex 5, described in [Vuex 5 RFC](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/271). You could simply consider Pinia as Vuex 5 with a different name. Pinia also works with Vue 2.x as well.\n\nVuex 3 and 4 will still be maintained. However, it's unlikely to add new functionalities to it. Vuex and Pinia can be installed in the same project. If you're migrating existing Vuex app to Pinia, it might be a suitable option. However, if you're planning to start a new project, we highly recommend using Pinia instead.\n\n---\n\nVuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official [devtools extension](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.\n\nLearn more about Vuex at \"[What is Vuex?](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)\", or get started by looking into [full documentation](http://vuex.vuejs.org/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo check out docs, visit [vuex.vuejs.org](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).\n\n## Examples\n\nYou may find example applications built with Vuex under the `examples` directory.\n\nRunning the examples:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ npm run dev # serve examples at localhost:8080\n```\n\n## Questions\n\nFor questions and support please use the [Discord chat server](https://chat.vuejs.org) or [the official forum](http://forum.vuejs.org). The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests.\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease make sure to read the [Issue Reporting Checklist](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/main/.github/contributing.md#issue-reporting-guidelines) before opening an issue. Issues not conforming to the guidelines may be closed immediately.\n\n## Changelog\n\nDetailed changes for each release are documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/releases).\n\n## Stay In Touch\n\nFor latest releases and announcements, follow on Twitter: [@vuejs](https://twitter.com/vuejs).\n\n## Contribution\n\nPlease make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex/blob/main/.github/contributing.md) before making a pull request.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-present Evan You\n",
