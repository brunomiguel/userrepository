An SFC loaded in custom elements mode inlines its `<style>` tags as strings under the component's `styles` option. When used with `defineCustomElement` from Vue core, the styles will be injected into the custom element's shadow root.\n\n  - Default is `/\\.ce\\.vue$/`\n  - Setting to `true` will process all `.vue` files in custom element mode.\n\n- `enableTsInTemplate: boolean` (16.8+): allow TS expressions in templates when `<script>` has `lang=\"ts\"`. Defaults to `true`.\n\n  - When used with `ts-loader`, due to `ts-loader`'s cache invalidation behavior, it sometimes prevents the template from being hot-reloaded in isolation, causing the component to reload despite only the template being edited. If this is annoying, you can set this option to `false` (and avoid using TS expressions in templates).\n\n  - Alternatively, leave this option on (by default) and use [`esbuild-loader`](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader) to transpile TS instead, which doesn't suffer from this problem (it's also a lot faster). However, do note you will need to rely on TS type checking from other sources (e.g. IDE or `vue-tsc`).\n\n## What is Vue Loader?\n\n`vue-loader` is a loader for [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) that allows you to author Vue components in a format called [Single-File Components (SFCs)](./docs/spec.md):\n\n```vue\n<template>\n  <div class=\"example\">{{ msg }}</div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      msg: 'Hello world!',\n    }\n  },\n}\n</script>\n\n<style>\n.example {\n  color: red;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nThere are many cool features provided by `vue-loader`:\n\n- Allows using other webpack loaders for each part of a Vue component, for example Sass for `<style>` and Pug for `<template>`;\n- Allows custom blocks in a `.vue` file that can have custom loader chains applied to them;\n- Treat static assets referenced in `<style>` and `<template>` as module dependencies and handle them with webpack loaders;\n- Simulate scoped CSS for each component;\n- State-preserving hot-reloading during development.\n\nIn a nutshell, the combination of webpack and `vue-loader` gives you a modern, flexible and extremely powerful front-end workflow for authoring Vue.js applications.\n\n## How It Works\n\n> The following section is for maintainers and contributors who are interested in the internal implementation details of `vue-loader`, and is **not** required knowledge for end users.\n\n`vue-loader` is not a simple source transform loader. It handles each language blocks inside an SFC with its own dedicated loader chain (you can think of each block as a \"virtual module\"), and finally assembles the blocks together into the final module. Here's a brief overview of how the whole thing works:\n\n1. `vue-loader` parses the SFC source code into an _SFC Descriptor_ using `@vue/compiler-sfc`. It then generates an import for each language block so the actual returned module code looks like this:\n\n   ```js\n   // code returned from the main loader for 'source.vue'\n\n   // import the <template> block\n   import render from 'source.vue?vue&type=template'\n   // import the <script> block\n   import script from 'source.vue?vue&type=script'\n   export * from 'source.vue?vue&type=script'\n   // import <style> blocks\n   import 'source.vue?vue&type=style&index=1'\n\n   script.render = render\n   export default script\n   ```\n\n   Notice how the code is importing `source.vue` itself, but with different request queries for each block.\n\n2. We want the content in `script` block to be treated like `.js` files (and if it's `<script lang=\"ts\">`, we want to to be treated like `.ts` files). Same for other language blocks. So we want webpack to apply any configured module rules that matches `.js` also to requests that look like `source.vue?vue&type=script`. This is what `VueLoaderPlugin` (`src/plugins.ts`) does: for each module rule in the webpack config, it creates a modified clone that targets corresponding Vue language block requests.\n\n   Suppose we have configured `babel-loader` for all `*.js` files. That rule will be cloned and applied to Vue SFC `<script>` blocks as well. Internally to webpack, a request like\n\n   ```js\n   import script from 'source.vue?vue&type=script'\n   ```\n\n   Will expand to:\n\n   ```js\n   import script from 'babel-loader!vue-loader!source.vue?vue&type=script'\n   ```\n\n   Notice the `vue-loader` is also matched because `vue-loader` are applied to `.vue` files.\n\n   Similarly, if you have configured `style-loader` + `css-loader` + `sass-loader` for `*.scss` files:\n\n   ```html\n   <style scoped lang=\"scss\">\n   ```\n\n   Will be returned by `vue-loader` as:\n\n   ```js\n   import 'source.vue?vue&type=style&index=1&scoped&lang=scss'\n   ```\n\n   And webpack will expand it to:\n\n   ```js\n   import 'style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader!vue-loader!source.vue?vue&type=style&index=1&scoped&lang=scss'\n   ```\n\n3. When processing the expanded requests, the main `vue-loader` will get invoked again. This time though, the loader notices that the request has queries and is targeting a specific block only. So it selects (`src/select.ts`) the inner content of the target block and passes it on to the loaders matched after it.\n\n4. For the `<script>` block, this is pretty much it. For `<template>` and `<style>` blocks though, a few extra tasks need to be performed:\n\n   - We need to compile the template using the Vue template compiler;\n   - We need to post-process the CSS in `<style scoped>` blocks, **after** `css-loader` but **before** `style-loader`.\n\n   Technically, these are additional loaders (`src/templateLoader.ts` and `src/stylePostLoader.ts`) that need to be injected into the expanded loader chain. It would be very complicated if the end users have to configure this themselves, so `VueLoaderPlugin` also injects a global [Pitching Loader](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#pitching-loader) (`src/pitcher.ts`) that intercepts Vue `<template>` and `<style>` requests and injects the necessary loaders. The final requests look like the following:\n\n   ```js\n   // <template lang=\"pug\">\n   import 'vue-loader/template-loader!pug-loader!source.vue?vue&type=template'\n\n   // <style scoped lang=\"scss\">\n   import 'style-loader!vue-loader/style-post-loader!css-loader!sass-loader!vue-loader!source.vue?vue&type=style&index=1&scoped&lang=scss'\n   ```\n",
