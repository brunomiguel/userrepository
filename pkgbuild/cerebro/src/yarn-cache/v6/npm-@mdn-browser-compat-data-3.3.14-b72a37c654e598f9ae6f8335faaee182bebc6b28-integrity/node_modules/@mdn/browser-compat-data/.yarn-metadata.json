For example:\n[Browser support for WebExtension APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs).\n\nRead how this project is [governed](GOVERNANCE.md).\n\nChat on [chat.mozilla.org#mdn](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `@mdn/browser-compat-data` as a node package.\n\n```\nnpm install @mdn/browser-compat-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst bcd = require('@mdn/browser-compat-data');\nbcd.css.properties.background;\n// returns a compat data object (see schema)\n```\n\n## Package contents\n\nThe `@mdn/browser-compat-data` package contains a tree of objects, with support and browser data objects at their leaves. There are over 12,000 features in the dataset; this documentation highlights significant portions, but many others exist at various levels of the tree.\n\nThe definitive description of the format used to represent individual features and browsers is the [schema definitions](schemas/).\n\nApart from the explicitly documented objects below, feature-level support data may change at any time. See [_Semantic versioning policy_](#Semantic-versioning-policy) for details.\n\nThe package contains the following top-level objects:\n\n### [`api`](api)\n\nData for [Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) features.\n\n### [`browsers`](browsers)\n\nData for browser and engine releases. See the [browser schema](schemas/browsers-schema.md) for details.\n\n### [`css`](css)\n\nData for [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) features, including:\n\n- `at-rules` - at-rules\n- `properties` - properties\n- `selectors` - selectors (such as basic selectors, combinators, or pseudo elements)\n- `types` - types for rule values\n\n### [`html`](html)\n\nData for [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) features, including:\n\n- `elements` - Elements\n- `global_attributes` - Global attributes\n- `manifest` - Web App manifest keys\n\n### [`http`](http)\n\nData for [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) features, including:\n\n- `headers` - Request and response headers\n- `methods` - Request methods\n- `status` - Status codes\n\n### [`javascript`](javascript)\n\nData for JavaScript language features, including:\n\n- `builtins` - Built-in objects\n- `classes` - Class definition features\n- `functions` - Function features\n- `grammar` - Language grammar\n- `operators` - Mathematical and logical operators\n- `statements` - Language statements and expressions\n\n### [`mathml`](mathml)\n\nData for [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) features, including:\n\n- `elements` - Elements\n\n### [`svg`](svg)\n\nData for [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) features, including:\n\n- `attributes` - Attributes\n- `elements` - Elements\n\n### [`webdriver`](webdriver)\n\nData for [WebDriver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver) features.\n\n### [`webextensions`](webextensions)\n\nData for [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) features, including:\n\n- `api` - WebExtension-specific APIs\n- `manifest` - `manifest.json` keys\n\n### [`xpath`](xpath)\n\nData for [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) features.\n\n### [`xslt`](xslt)\n\nData for [XSLT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT) features.\n\n## Semantic versioning policy\n\nFor the purposes of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer), the public API consists of:\n\n- The high-level namespace objects documented in [_Package contents_](#Package-contents)\n- The schema definitions for browser and support data structures\n\nThe details of browser compatibility change frequently, as browsers ship new features, standards organizations revise specifications, and Web developers discover new bugs. We routinely publish updates to the package to reflect these changes.\n\nYou should expect lower-level namespaces, feature data, and browser data to be added, removed, or modified at any time. That said, we strive to communicate changes and preserve backward compatibility; if you rely on a currently undocumented portion of the package and want SemVer to apply to it, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues).\n\n## Issues?\n\nIf you find a problem, please [file a bug](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/new).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe're very happy to accept contributions to this data. See [Contributing to browser-compat-data](/docs/contributing.md) for more information.\n\n## Projects using the data\n\nHere are some projects using the data, as an [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/@mdn/browser-compat-data) or directly:\n\n- [Add-ons Linter](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-linter) - the Add-ons Linter is used on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/) and the [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext/) tool. It uses browser-compat-data to check that the Firefox version that the add-on lists support for does in fact support the APIs used by the add-on.\n- [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) - In addition to the existing caniuse database, caniuse includes features from the MDN BCD project, formatted and interactive like any other caniuse support table.\n- [CanIUse Embed](https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/) - Thanks to the inclusion of MDN BCD data in caniuse, this embed tool allows for embedding BCD data into any project.\n- [Compat Report](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/compat-report/) - Firefox Add-on that shows compatibility data for the current site in the developer tools.\n- [compat-tester](https://github.com/SphinxKnight/compat-tester) - Scan local documents for compatibility issues.\n- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Shows the compatibility information in [the code completion popup](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_25#_improved-accuracy-of-browser-compatibility-data).\n- [webhint.io](https://webhint.io/docs/user-guide/hints/hint-compat-api/) - Hints to check if your CSS HTML and JavaScript have deprecated or not broadly supported features.\n- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/#v2019-1-html-and-css) - JavaScript IDE allowing you to check whether all CSS properties you use are supported in the target browser version.\n- [Hexo Plugin: hexo-compat-report](https://github.com/TimDaub/hexo-compat-report) - Allows to embed MDN's compatibility table in a hexo blog post.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThanks to:\n\n<table>\n  <tr align=\"center\">\n    <td>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498917/52569900-852b3080-2e12-11e9-9bd0-f1e256b13e53.png\"\n        height=\"86\"\n        alt=\"BrowserStack\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        The\n        <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/open-source\"\n          >BrowserStack Open Source Program</a\n        >\n        for testing services\n      </p>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://opensource.saucelabs.com/images/opensauce/powered-by-saucelabs-badge-white.png?sanitize=true\"\n        height=\"86\"\n        alt=\"Testing Powered By Sauce Labs\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        <a href=\"https://opensource.saucelabs.com/\">Sauce Labs Open Source</a\n        >\n        for testing services\n      </p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n",
    "licenseText": "CC0 1.0 Universal\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and\nsubsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the\npurpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific\nworks (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later\nclaims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse\nand redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any\npurposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.
