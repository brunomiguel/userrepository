Run `posthog` locally on port 8000 (`DEBUG=1 TEST=1 ./bin/start`)\n2. Run `python manage.py setup_dev --no-data` on posthog repo, which sets up a demo account\n3. Optional: rebuild array.js on changes: `nodemon -w src/ --exec bash -c \"yarn build-array\"`\n4. Export browserstack credentials: `export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=xxx BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=xxx`\n5. Run tests: `npx testcafe \"browserstack:ie\" testcafe/e2e.spec.js`\n\n## Developing together with another repo\n\nUpdate dependency in package.json to e.g. `\"posthog-js\": \"link:../posthog-js\"`, `yarn` and run `yarn build && yarn build-module`\n\n## Releasing a new version\n\nAdd a label `bump X` label to a PR before merging (e.g. `bump patch`).\n\nThis will create a new npm version, update tags, changelog and create a PR [in the main repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog).\n\n### Alternative (manual) \n\nTo release a new version, make sure you're logged in to NPM (`npm login`)\n\nWe tend to follow the following steps:\n\n1. Merge your changes into master\n2. Release changes as a beta version\n    - `npm version 1.x.x-beta.0`\n    - `npm publish --tag beta`\n    - `git push --tags`\n3. Create a PR linking to this version [in the main repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog)\n4. Once deployed and tested, write up CHANGELOG.md, and commit.\n5. Release a new version\n    - `npm version 1.x.x`\n    - `npm publish`\n    - `git push --tags`\n6. Create a PR linking to this version [in the main repo](https://github.com/posthog/posthog)\n\n## Questions?\n\n### [Join our Slack community.](https://join.slack.com/t/posthogusers/shared_invite/enQtOTY0MzU5NjAwMDY3LTc2MWQ0OTZlNjhkODk3ZDI3NDVjMDE1YjgxY2I4ZjI4MzJhZmVmNjJkN2NmMGJmMzc2N2U3Yjc3ZjI5NGFlZDQ)\n",
