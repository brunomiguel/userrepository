(or pipe)  other | pbjs [options] -\n```\n\nFor production environments it is recommended to bundle all your .proto files to a single .json file, which minimizes the number of network requests and avoids any parser overhead (hint: works with just the **light** library):\n\n```\n$> pbjs -t json file1.proto file2.proto > bundle.json\n```\n\nNow, either include this file in your final bundle:\n\n```js\nvar root = protobuf.Root.fromJSON(require(\"./bundle.json\"));\n```\n\nor load it the usual way:\n\n```js\nprotobuf.load(\"bundle.json\", function(err, root) {\n    ...\n});\n```\n\nGenerated static code, on the other hand, works with just the **minimal** library. For example\n\n```\n$> pbjs -t static-module -w commonjs -o compiled.js file1.proto file2.proto\n```\n\nwill generate static code for definitions within `file1.proto` and `file2.proto` to a CommonJS module `compiled.js`.\n\n**ProTip!** Documenting your .proto files with `/** ... */`-blocks or (trailing) `/// ...` lines translates to generated static code.\n\n\n### pbts for TypeScript\n\n```\nGenerates TypeScript definitions from annotated JavaScript files.\n\n  -o, --out       Saves to a file instead of writing to stdout.\n\n  -g, --global    Name of the global object in browser environments, if any.\n\n  --no-comments   Does not output any JSDoc comments.\n\n  Internal flags:\n\n  -n, --name      Wraps everything in a module of the specified name.\n\n  -m, --main      Whether building the main library without any imports.\n\nusage: pbts [options] file1.js file2.js ...  (or)  other | pbts [options] -\n```\n\nPicking up on the example above, the following not only generates static code to a CommonJS module `compiled.js` but also its respective TypeScript definitions to `compiled.d.ts`:\n\n```\n$> pbjs -t static-module -w commonjs -o compiled.js file1.proto file2.proto\n$> pbts -o compiled.d.ts compiled.js\n```\n\nAdditionally, TypeScript definitions of static modules are compatible with their reflection-based counterparts (i.e. as exported by JSON modules), as long as the following conditions are met:\n\n1. Instead of using `new SomeMessage(...)`, always use `SomeMessage.create(...)` because reflection objects do not provide a constructor.\n2. Types, services and enums must start with an uppercase letter to become available as properties of the reflected types as well (i.e. to be able to use `MyMessage.MyEnum` instead of `root.lookup(\"MyMessage.MyEnum\")`).\n\nFor example, the following generates a JSON module `bundle.js` and a `bundle.d.ts`, but no static code:\n\n```\n$> pbjs -t json-module -w commonjs -o bundle.js file1.proto file2.proto\n$> pbjs -t static-module file1.proto file2.proto | pbts -o bundle.d.ts -\n```\n\n### Reflection vs. static code\n\nWhile using .proto files directly requires the full library respectively pure reflection/JSON the light library, pretty much all code but the relatively short descriptors is shared.\n\nStatic code, on the other hand, requires just the minimal library, but generates additional source code without any reflection features. This also implies that there is a break-even point where statically generated code becomes larger than descriptor-based code once the amount of code generated exceeds the size of the full respectively light library.\n\nThere is no significant difference performance-wise as the code generated statically is pretty much the same as generated at runtime and both are largely interchangeable as seen in the previous section.\n\n| Source | Library | Advantages | Tradeoffs\n|--------|---------|------------|-----------\n| .proto | full    | Easily editable<br />Interoperability with other libraries<br />No compile step | Some parsing and possibly network overhead\n| JSON   | light   | Easily editable<br />No parsing overhead<br />Single bundle (no network overhead) | protobuf.js specific<br />Has a compile step\n| static | minimal | Works where `eval` access is restricted<br />Fully documented<br />Small footprint for small protos | Can be hard to edit<br />No reflection<br />Has a compile step\n\n### Command line API\n\nBoth utilities can be used programmatically by providing command line arguments and a callback to their respective `main` functions:\n\n```js\nvar pbjs = require(\"protobufjs-cli/pbjs\"); // or require(\"protobufjs-cli\").pbjs / .pbts\n\npbjs.main([ \"--target\", \"json-module\", \"path/to/myproto.proto\" ], function(err, output) {\n    if (err)\n        throw err;\n    // do something with output\n});\n```\n\n**License:** [BSD 3-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n",
