Follow along with [Issue 6367](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/6367).\n\n# RxJS 7\n\n### FOR 6.X PLEASE GO TO [THE 6.x BRANCH](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/tree/6.x)\n\nReactive Extensions Library for JavaScript. This is a rewrite of [Reactive-Extensions/RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and is the latest production-ready version of RxJS. This rewrite is meant to have better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.\n\n[Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE.txt)\n\n- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Maintainer Guidelines](docs_app/content/maintainer-guidelines.md)\n- [API Documentation](https://rxjs.dev/)\n\n## Versions In This Repository\n\n- [master](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/commits/master) - This is all of the current work, which is against v7 of RxJS right now\n- [6.x](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/tree/6.x) - This is the branch for version 6.X\n\nMost PRs should be made to **master**.\n\n## Important\n\nBy contributing or commenting on issues in this repository, whether you've read them or not, you're agreeing to the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Much like traffic laws, ignorance doesn't grant you immunity.\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\n### ES6 via npm\n\n```shell\nnpm install rxjs\n```\n\nIt's recommended to pull in the Observable creation methods you need directly from `'rxjs'` as shown below with `range`.\nIf you're using RxJS version 7.2 or above, you can pull in any operator you need from the same spot, `'rxjs'`.\n\n```ts\nimport { range, filter, map } from 'rxjs';\n\nrange(1, 200)\n  .pipe(\n    filter(x => x % 2 === 1),\n    map(x => x + x)\n  )\n  .subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n```\n\nIf you're using RxJS version below 7.2, you can pull in any operator you need from one spot, under `'rxjs/operators'`.\n\n```ts\nimport { range } from 'rxjs';\nimport { filter, map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\nrange(1, 200)\n  .pipe(\n    filter(x => x % 2 === 1),\n    map(x => x + x)\n  )\n  .subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n```\n\n### CDN\n\nFor CDN, you can use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):\n\n[https://unpkg.com/rxjs@^7/dist/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js](https://unpkg.com/rxjs@%5E7/dist/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js)\n\nThe global namespace for rxjs is `rxjs`:\n\n```js\nconst { range } = rxjs;\nconst { filter, map } = rxjs.operators;\n\nrange(1, 200)\n  .pipe(\n    filter(x => x % 2 === 1),\n    map(x => x + x)\n  )\n  .subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n```\n\n## Goals\n\n- Smaller overall bundles sizes\n- Provide better performance than preceding versions of RxJS\n- To model/follow the [Observable Spec Proposal](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable) to the observable\n- Provide more modular file structure in a variety of formats\n- Provide more debuggable call stacks than preceding versions of RxJS\n\n## Building/Testing\n\n- `npm run compile` build everything\n- `npm test` run tests\n- `npm run dtslint` run dtslint tests\n\n## Adding documentation\n\nWe appreciate all contributions to the documentation of any type. All of the information needed to get the docs app up and running locally as well as how to contribute can be found in the [documentation directory](./docs_app).\n",

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n 6.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n    replaced with your own identifying information.
