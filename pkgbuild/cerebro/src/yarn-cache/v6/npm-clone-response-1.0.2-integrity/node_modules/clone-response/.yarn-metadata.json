However, you can consume a stream multiple times in the same tick, therefore allowing you to create multiple clones. e.g:\n\n```js\nconst clone1 = cloneResponse(response);\nconst clone2 = cloneResponse(response);\n// response can still be consumed in this tick but cannot be consumed if passed\n// into any async callbacks. clone1 and clone2 can be passed around and be\n// consumed in the future.\n```\n\n## API\n\n### cloneResponse(response)\n\nReturns a clone of the passed in response.\n\n#### response\n\nType: `stream`\n\nA [Node.js HTTP response stream](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) to clone.\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© Luke Childs\n",
