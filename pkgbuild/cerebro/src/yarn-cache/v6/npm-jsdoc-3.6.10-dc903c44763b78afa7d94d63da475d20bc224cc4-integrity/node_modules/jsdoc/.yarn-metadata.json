Please read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\n\nInstallation and Usage\n----------------------\n\nJSDoc supports stable versions of Node.js 8.15.0 and later. You can install\nJSDoc globally or in your project's `node_modules` folder.\n\nTo install the latest version on npm globally (might require `sudo`;\n[learn how to fix this](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)):\n\n    npm install -g jsdoc\n\nTo install the latest version on npm locally and save it in your package's\n`package.json` file:\n\n    npm install --save-dev jsdoc\n\n**Note**: By default, npm adds your package using the caret operator in front of\nthe version number (for example, `^3.6.3`). We recommend using the tilde\noperator instead (for example, `~3.6.3`), which limits updates to the most\nrecent patch-level version. See\n[this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22343224) for\nmore information about the caret and tilde operators.\n\nTo install the latest development version locally, without updating your\nproject's `package.json` file:\n\n    npm install git+https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc.git\n\nIf you installed JSDoc locally, the JSDoc command-line tool is available in\n`./node_modules/.bin`. To generate documentation for the file\n`yourJavaScriptFile.js`:\n\n    ./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js\n\nIf you installed JSDoc globally, run the `jsdoc` command:\n\n    jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js\n\nBy default, the generated documentation is saved in a directory named `out`. You\ncan use the `--destination` (`-d`) option to specify another directory.\n\nRun `jsdoc --help` for a complete list of command-line options.\n\n## Templates and tools\n\nThe JSDoc community has created templates and other tools to help you generate\nand customize your documentation. Here are a few of them:\n\n### Templates\n\n+ [jaguarjs-jsdoc](https://github.com/davidshimjs/jaguarjs-jsdoc)\n+ [DocStrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap)\n([example](https://docstrap.github.io/docstrap))\n+ [jsdoc3Template](https://github.com/DBCDK/jsdoc3Template)\n  ([example](https://github.com/danyg/jsdoc3Template/wiki#wiki-screenshots))\n+ [minami](https://github.com/Nijikokun/minami)\n+ [docdash](https://github.com/clenemt/docdash)\n([example](http://clenemt.github.io/docdash/))\n+ [tui-jsdoc-template](https://github.com/nhnent/tui.jsdoc-template)\n([example](https://nhnent.github.io/tui.jsdoc-template/latest/))\n+ [better-docs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs)\n([example](https://softwarebrothers.github.io/admin-bro-dev/index.html))\n\n### Build tools\n\n+ [JSDoc Grunt plugin](https://github.com/krampstudio/grunt-jsdoc)\n+ [JSDoc Gulp plugin](https://github.com/mlucool/gulp-jsdoc3)\n\n### Other tools\n\n+ [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown)\n+ [Integrating GitBook with\nJSDoc](https://medium.com/@kevinast/integrate-gitbook-jsdoc-974be8df6fb3)\n\n## For more information\n\n+ Documentation is available at [jsdoc.app](https://jsdoc.app/).\n+ Contribute to the docs at\n[jsdoc/jsdoc.github.io](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc.github.io).\n+ [Join JSDoc's Slack channel](https://jsdoc-slack.appspot.com/).\n+ Ask for help on the\n[JSDoc Users mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jsdoc-users).\n+ Post questions tagged `jsdoc` to\n[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jsdoc).\n\n## License\n\nJSDoc 3 is copyright (c) 2011-present Michael Mathews <micmath@gmail.com> and\nthe [contributors to JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc/graphs/contributors).\n\nJSDoc 3 is free software, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
