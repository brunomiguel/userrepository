This is my take.\n\n**YOU MUST PIPE ALL CLONES TO START THE FLOW**\n\nYou can also attach `'data'` and `'readable'` events to them.\n\n## API\n\n### cloneable(stream)\n\nCreate a `Cloneable` stream.\nA Cloneable has a `clone()` method to create more clones.\nAll clones must be resumed/piped to start the flow.\n\n### cloneable.isCloneable(stream)\n\nCheck if `stream` needs to be wrapped in a `Cloneable` or not.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project was kindly sponsored by [nearForm](http://nearform.com).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
