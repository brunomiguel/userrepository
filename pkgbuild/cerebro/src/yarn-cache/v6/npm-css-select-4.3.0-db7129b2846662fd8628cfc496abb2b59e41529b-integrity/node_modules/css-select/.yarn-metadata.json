To query alternative DOM structures, see [`Options`](#options)\nbelow.\n\n**Features:**\n\n-   üî¨ Full implementation of CSS3 selectors, as well as most CSS4 selectors\n-   üß™ Partial implementation of jQuery/Sizzle extensions (see\n    [cheerio-select](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio-select) for the\n    remaining selectors)\n-   üßë‚Äçüî¨ High test coverage, including the full test suites from Sizzle, Qwery and\n    NWMatcher.\n-   ü•º Reliably great performance\n\n## Why?\n\nMost CSS engines written in JavaScript execute selectors left-to-right. That\nmeans thet execute every component of the selector in order, from left to right\n_(duh)_. As an example: For the selector `a b`, these engines will first query\nfor `a` elements, then search these for `b` elements. (That's the approach of\neg. [`Sizzle`](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle),\n[`nwmatcher`](https://github.com/dperini/nwmatcher/) and\n[`qwery`](https://github.com/ded/qwery).)\n\nWhile this works, it has some downsides: Children of `a`s will be checked\nmultiple times; first, to check if they are also `a`s, then, for every superior\n`a` once, if they are `b`s. Using\n[Big O notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), that would be\n`O(n^(k+1))`, where `k` is the number of descendant selectors (that's the space\nin the example above).\n\nThe far more efficient approach is to first look for `b` elements, then check if\nthey have superior `a` elements: Using big O notation again, that would be\n`O(n)`. That's called right-to-left execution.\n\nAnd that's what css-select does ‚Äì and why it's quite performant.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nBy building a stack of functions.\n\n_Wait, what?_\n\nOkay, so let's suppose we want to compile the selector `a b`, for right-to-left\nexecution. We start by _parsing_ the selector. This turns the selector into an\narray of the building blocks. That's what the\n[`css-what`](https://github.com/fb55/css-what) module is for, if you want to\nhave a look.\n\nAnyway, after parsing, we end up with an array like this one:\n\n```js\n[\n    { type: \"tag\", name: \"a\" },\n    { type: \"descendant\" },\n    { type: \"tag\", name: \"b\" },\n];\n```\n\n(Actually, this array is wrapped in another array, but that's another story,\ninvolving commas in selectors.)\n\nNow that we know the meaning of every part of the selector, we can compile it.\nThat is where things become interesting.\n\nThe basic idea is to turn every part of the selector into a function, which\ntakes an element as its only argument. The function checks whether a passed\nelement matches its part of the selector: If it does, the element is passed to\nthe next function representing the next part of the selector. That function does\nthe same. If an element is accepted by all parts of the selector, it _matches_\nthe selector and double rainbow ALL THE WAY.\n\nAs said before, we want to do right-to-left execution with all the big O\nimprovements. That means elements are passed from the rightmost part of the\nselector (`b` in our example) to the leftmost (~~which would be `c`~~ of course\n`a`).\n\nFor traversals, such as the _descendant_ operating the space between `a` and\n`b`, we walk up the DOM tree, starting from the element passed as argument.\n\n_//TODO: More in-depth description. Implementation details. Build a spaceship._\n\n## API\n\n```js\nconst CSSselect = require(\"css-select\");\n```\n\n**Note:** css-select throws errors when invalid selectors are passed to it.This\nis done to aid with writing css selectors, but can be unexpected when processing\narbitrary strings.\n\n#### `CSSselect.selectAll(query, elems, options)`\n\nQueries `elems`, returns an array containing all matches.\n\n-   `query` can be either a CSS selector or a function.\n-   `elems` can be either an array of elements, or a single element. If it is an\n    element, its children will be queried.\n-   `options` is described below.\n\nAliases: `default` export, `CSSselect.iterate(query, elems)`.\n\n#### `CSSselect.compile(query, options)`\n\nCompiles the query, returns a function.\n\n#### `CSSselect.is(elem, query, options)`\n\nTests whether or not an element is matched by `query`. `query` can be either a\nCSS selector or a function.\n\n#### `CSSselect.selectOne(query, elems, options)`\n\nArguments are the same as for `CSSselect.selectAll(query, elems)`. Only returns\nthe first match, or `null` if there was no match.\n\n### Options\n\nAll options are optional.\n\n-   `xmlMode`: When enabled, tag names will be case-sensitive. Default: `false`.\n-   `rootFunc`: The last function in the stack, will be called with the last\n    element that's looked at.\n-   `adapter`: The adapter to use when interacting with the backing DOM\n    structure. By default it uses the `domutils` module.\n-   `context`: The context of the current query. Used to limit the scope of\n    searches. Can be matched directly using the `:scope` pseudo-selector.\n-   `cacheResults`: Allow css-select to cache results for some selectors,\n    sometimes greatly improving querying performance. Disable this if your\n    document can change in between queries with the same compiled selector.\n    Default: `true`.\n\n#### Custom Adapters\n\nA custom adapter must match the interface described\n[here](https://github.com/fb55/css-select/blob/1aa44bdd64aaf2ebdfd7f338e2e76bed36521957/src/types.ts#L6-L96).\n\nYou may want to have a look at [`domutils`](https://github.com/fb55/domutils) to\nsee the default implementation, or at\n[`css-select-browser-adapter`](https://github.com/nrkn/css-select-browser-adapter/blob/master/index.js)\nfor an implementation backed by the DOM.\n\n## Supported selectors\n\n_As defined by CSS 4 and / or jQuery._\n\n-   [Selector lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list)\n    (`,`)\n-   [Universal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors)\n    (`*`)\n-   [Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors)\n    (`<tagname>`)\n-   [Descendant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator)\n    (` `)\n-   [Child](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator)\n    (`>`)\n-   Parent (`<`)\n-   [Adjacent sibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator)\n    (`+`)\n-   [General sibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator)\n    (`~`)\n-   [Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)\n    (`[attr=foo]`), with supported comparisons:\n    -   `[attr]` (existential)\n    -   `=`\n    -   `~=`\n    -   `|=`\n    -   `*=`\n    -   `^=`\n    -   `$=`\n    -   `!=`\n    -   `i` and `s` can be added after the comparison to make the comparison\n        case-insensitive or case-sensitive (eg. `[attr=foo i]`).
