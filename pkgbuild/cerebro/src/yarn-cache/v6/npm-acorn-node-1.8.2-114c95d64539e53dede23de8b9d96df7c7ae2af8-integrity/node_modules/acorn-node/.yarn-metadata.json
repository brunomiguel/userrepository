Comes preconfigured for the syntax plugins if necessary.\nSee the [acorn documentation](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn#distwalkjs) for details.\n\n## License\n\nThe files in the repo root and the ./test folder are licensed as [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.md).\n\nThe files in lib/ are generated from other packages:\n\n- lib/bigint: [acorn-bigint](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-bigint]), MIT\n- lib/class-private-elements: [acorn-class-private-elements](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-class-private-elements), MIT\n- lib/dynamic-import: [acorn-dynamic-import](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-dynamic-import), MIT\n- lib/export-ns-from: [acorn-export-ns-from](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-export-ns-from), MIT\n- lib/import-meta: [acorn-import-meta](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-import-meta), MIT\n- lib/numeric-separator: [acorn-numeric-separator](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-numeric-separator]), MIT\n- lib/static-class-features: [acorn-static-class-features](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-static-class-features), MIT\n",
