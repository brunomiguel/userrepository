As of through2@3.x, readable-stream@3 is being used and is not compatible with older versions of Node.js.*** _v2.x support is being maintained on the [v2.x](https://github.com/rvagg/through2/tree/v2.x) branch._\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream('ex.txt')\n  .pipe(through2(function (chunk, enc, callback) {\n    for (var i = 0; i < chunk.length; i++)\n      if (chunk[i] == 97)\n        chunk[i] = 122 // swap 'a' for 'z'\n\n    this.push(chunk)\n\n    callback()\n   }))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('out.txt'))\n  .on('finish', () => doSomethingSpecial())\n```\n\nOr object streams:\n\n```js\nvar all = []\n\nfs.createReadStream('data.csv')\n  .pipe(csv2())\n  .pipe(through2.obj(function (chunk, enc, callback) {\n    var data = {\n        name    : chunk[0]\n      , address : chunk[3]\n      , phone   : chunk[10]\n    }\n    this.push(data)\n\n    callback()\n  }))\n  .on('data', (data) => {\n    all.push(data)\n  })\n  .on('end', () => {\n    doSomethingSpecial(all)\n  })\n```\n\nNote that `through2.obj(fn)` is a convenience wrapper around `through2({ objectMode: true }, fn)`.\n\n## API\n\n<b><code>through2([ options, ] [ transformFunction ] [, flushFunction ])</code></b>\n\nConsult the **[stream.Transform](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform)** documentation for the exact rules of the `transformFunction` (i.e. `this._transform`) and the optional `flushFunction` (i.e. `this._flush`).\n\n### options\n\nThe options argument is optional and is passed straight through to `stream.Transform`. So you can use `objectMode:true` if you are processing non-binary streams (or just use `through2.obj()`).\n\nThe `options` argument is first, unlike standard convention, because if I'm passing in an anonymous function then I'd prefer for the options argument to not get lost at the end of the call:\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream('/tmp/important.dat')\n  .pipe(through2({ objectMode: true, allowHalfOpen: false },\n    (chunk, enc, cb) => {\n      cb(null, 'wut?') // note we can use the second argument on the callback\n                       // to provide data as an alternative to this.push('wut?')\n    }\n  )\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/wut.txt'))\n```\n\n### transformFunction\n\nThe `transformFunction` must have the following signature: `function (chunk, encoding, callback) {}`. A minimal implementation should call the `callback` function to indicate that the transformation is done, even if that transformation means discarding the chunk.\n\nTo queue a new chunk, call `this.push(chunk)`&mdash;this can be called as many times as required before the `callback()` if you have multiple pieces to send on.\n\nAlternatively, you may use `callback(err, chunk)` as shorthand for emitting a single chunk or an error.\n\nIf you **do not provide a `transformFunction`** then you will get a simple pass-through stream.\n\n### flushFunction\n\nThe optional `flushFunction` is provided as the last argument (2nd or 3rd, depending on whether you've supplied options) is called just prior to the stream ending. Can be used to finish up any processing that may be in progress.\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream('/tmp/important.dat')\n  .pipe(through2(\n    (chunk, enc, cb) => cb(null, chunk), // transform is a noop\n    function (cb) { // flush function\n      this.push('tacking on an extra buffer to the end');\n      cb();\n    }\n  ))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/wut.txt'));\n```\n\n<b><code>through2.ctor([ options, ] transformFunction[, flushFunction ])</code></b>\n\nInstead of returning a `stream.Transform` instance, `through2.ctor()` returns a **constructor** for a custom Transform. This is useful when you want to use the same transform logic in multiple instances.\n\n```js\nvar FToC = through2.ctor({objectMode: true}, function (record, encoding, callback) {\n  if (record.temp != null && record.unit == \"F\") {\n    record.temp = ( ( record.temp - 32 ) * 5 ) / 9\n    record.unit = \"C\"\n  }\n  this.push(record)\n  callback()\n})\n\n// Create instances of FToC like so:\nvar converter = new FToC()\n// Or:\nvar converter = FToC()\n// Or specify/override options when you instantiate, if you prefer:\nvar converter = FToC({objectMode: true})\n```\n\n## See Also\n\n  - [through2-map](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-map) - Array.prototype.map analog for streams.\n  - [through2-filter](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-filter) - Array.prototype.filter analog for streams.\n  - [through2-reduce](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-reduce) - Array.prototype.reduce analog for streams.\n  - [through2-spy](https://github.com/brycebaril/through2-spy) - Wrapper for simple stream.PassThrough spies.\n  - the [mississippi stream utility collection](https://github.com/maxogden/mississippi) includes `through2` as well as many more useful stream modules similar to this one\n\n## License\n\n**through2** is Copyright (c) Rod Vagg and additional contributors and licensed under the MIT license.
