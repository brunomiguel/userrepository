    "readme": "# electron-forge-maker-appimage\n\nThis is an [electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) builder for [AppImage](https://appimage.org/).\n\nIt's far from complete, but it serves the basic needs of our application.\n\nThis is based on several existing projects.\n\n[electron-forge-maker-appimage](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/tree/master/packages/electron-forge-maker-appimage)\nThis is the previous maker for electron forge. It does not work, I suspect it uses an older maker API and was never updated.\n\nWorking electron-forge makers can be found here. These were used as an example when creating this maker:\nhttps://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/tree/master/packages/maker\n\nSome parts of electron-builder are still used, specifically [app-builder-lib](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/tree/master/packages/app-builder-lib)\n\nOverall, I suspect app-builder-lib isn't meant to work with electron-forge makers anymore. I am using the components that specifically wrap [app-builder](https://github.com/develar/app-builder), the tool that actually prepares the AppImage.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nyarn add --dev https://github.com/Marcus10110/electron-forge-maker-appimage.git\n```\n\n## example forgeconfig.js\n\n```\nmakers: [\n  {\n    name: 'electron-forge-maker-appimage',\n    platforms: ['linux'],\n    config: { template: 'assets/AppRunTemplate.sh' },\n  },\n];\n\n```\n\nThis was created specifically because we wanted to use AppImage's AppRun script to detect and load modern versions of libstdc++ and libgcc_s on older systems.",
