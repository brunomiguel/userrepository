If the reference is gone, it meant no one else was pointing to the object.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\n(async function () {\n  let reference = {};\n  let isLeaking;\n\n  const detector = new LeakDetector(reference);\n\n  // Reference is held in memory.\n  isLeaking = await detector.isLeaking();\n  console.log(isLeaking); // true\n\n  // We destroy the only reference to the object.\n  reference = null;\n\n  // Reference is gone.\n  isLeaking = await detector.isLeaking();\n  console.log(isLeaking); // false\n})();\n```\n",
