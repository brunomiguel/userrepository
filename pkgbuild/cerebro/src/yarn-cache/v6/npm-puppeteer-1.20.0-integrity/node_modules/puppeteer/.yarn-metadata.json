Puppeteer runs [headless](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.\n\n<!-- [START usecases] -->\n###### What can I do?\n\nMost things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:\n\n* Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.\n* Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. \"SSR\" (Server-Side Rendering)).\n* Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.\n* Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.\n* Capture a [timeline trace](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference) of your site to help diagnose performance issues.\n* Test Chrome Extensions.\n<!-- [END usecases] -->\n\nGive it a spin: https://try-puppeteer.appspot.com/\n\n<!-- [START getstarted] -->\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installation\n\nTo use Puppeteer in your project, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm i puppeteer\n# or \"yarn add puppeteer\"\n```\n\nNote: When you install Puppeteer, it downloads a recent version of Chromium (~170MB Mac, ~282MB Linux, ~280MB Win) that is guaranteed to work with the API. To skip the download, see [Environment variables](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#environment-variables).\n\n\n### puppeteer-core\n\nSince version 1.7.0 we publish the [`puppeteer-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core) package,\na version of Puppeteer that doesn't download Chromium by default.\n\n```bash\nnpm i puppeteer-core\n# or \"yarn add puppeteer-core\"\n```\n\n`puppeteer-core` is intended to be a lightweight version of Puppeteer for launching an existing browser installation or for connecting to a remote one. Be sure that the version of puppeteer-core you install is compatible with the\nbrowser you intend to connect to.\n\nSee [puppeteer vs puppeteer-core](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#puppeteer-vs-puppeteer-core).\n\n### Usage\n\nNote: Puppeteer requires at least Node v6.4.0, but the examples below use async/await which is only supported in Node v7.6.0 or greater.\n\nPuppeteer will be familiar to people using other browser testing frameworks. You create an instance\nof `Browser`, open pages, and then manipulate them with [Puppeteer's API](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#).\n\n**Example** - navigating to https://example.com and saving a screenshot as *example.png*:\n\nSave file as **example.js**\n\n```js\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  await page.screenshot({path: 'example.png'});\n\n  await browser.close();\n})();\n```\n\nExecute script on the command line\n\n```bash\nnode example.js\n```\n\nPuppeteer sets an initial page size to 800×600px, which defines the screenshot size. The page size can be customized  with [`Page.setViewport()`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#pagesetviewportviewport).\n\n**Example** - create a PDF.\n\nSave file as **hn.js**\n\n```js\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://news.ycombinator.com', {waitUntil: 'networkidle2'});\n  await page.pdf({path: 'hn.pdf', format: 'A4'});\n\n  await browser.close();\n})();\n```\n\nExecute script on the command line\n\n```bash\nnode hn.js\n```\n\nSee [`Page.pdf()`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#pagepdfoptions) for more information about creating pdfs.\n\n**Example** - evaluate script in the context of the page\n\nSave file as **get-dimensions.js**\n\n```js\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\n\n(async () => {\n  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n\n  // Get the \"viewport\" of the page, as reported by the page.\n  const dimensions = await page.evaluate(() => {\n    return {\n      width: document.documentElement.clientWidth,\n      height: document.documentElement.clientHeight,\n      deviceScaleFactor: window.devicePixelRatio\n    };\n  });\n\n  console.log('Dimensions:', dimensions);\n\n  await browser.close();\n})();\n```\n\nExecute script on the command line\n\n```bash\nnode get-dimensions.js\n```\n\nSee [`Page.evaluate()`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#pageevaluatepagefunction-args) for more information on `evaluate` and related methods like `evaluateOnNewDocument` and `exposeFunction`.\n\n<!-- [END getstarted] -->\n\n<!-- [START runtimesettings] -->\n## Default runtime settings\n\n**1. Uses Headless mode**\n\nPuppeteer launches Chromium in [headless mode](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome). To launch a full version of Chromium, set the [`headless` option](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#puppeteerlaunchoptions) when launching a browser:\n\n```js\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false}); // default is true\n```\n\n**2. Runs a bundled version of Chromium**\n\nBy default, Puppeteer downloads and uses a specific version of Chromium so its API\nis guaranteed to work out of the box. To use Puppeteer with a different version of Chrome or Chromium,\npass in the executable's path when creating a `Browser` instance:\n\n```js\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({executablePath: '/path/to/Chrome'});\n```\n\nSee [`Puppeteer.launch()`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#puppeteerlaunchoptions) for more information.\n\nSee [`this article`](https://www.howtogeek.com/202825/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-chromium-and-chrome/) for a description of the differences between Chromium and Chrome. [`This article`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/chromium_browser_vs_google_chrome.md) describes some differences for Linux users.\n\n**3. Creates a fresh user profile**\n\nPuppeteer creates its own Chromium user profile which it **cleans up on every run**.\n\n<!-- [END runtimesettings] -->\n\n## Resources\n\n- [API Documentation](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/tree/master/examples/)\n- [Community list of Puppeteer resources](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/awesome-puppeteer)\n\n\n<!-- [START debugging] -->\n\n## Debugging tips\n\n1. Turn off headless mode - sometimes it's useful to see what the browser is\n   displaying. Instead of launching in headless mode, launch a full version of\n   the browser using  `headless: false`:\n\n        const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false});\n\n2. Slow it down - the `slowMo` option slows down Puppeteer operations by the\n   specified amount of milliseconds. It's another way to help see what's going on.\n\n        const browser = await puppeteer.launch({\n          headless: false,\n          slowMo: 250 // slow down by 250ms\n        });\n\n3. Capture console output - You can listen for the `console` event.\n   This is also handy when debugging code in `page.evaluate()`:\n\n        page.on('console', msg => console.log('PAGE LOG:', msg.text()));\n\n        await page.evaluate(() => console.log(`url is ${location.href}`));\n\n4. Use debugger in application code browser\n\n    There are two execution context: node.js that is running test code, and the browser\n    running application code being tested. This lets you debug code in the\n    application code browser; ie code inside `evaluate()`.\n\n    - Use `{devtools: true}` when launching Puppeteer:\n\n        `const browser = await puppeteer.launch({devtools: true});`\n\n    - Change default test timeout:\n\n        jest: `jest.setTimeout(100000);`\n\n        jasmine: `jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 100000;`\n\n        mocha: `this.timeout(100000);` (don't forget to change test to use [function and not '=>'](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23492442))\n\n    - Add an evaluate statement with `debugger` inside / add  `debugger` to an existing evaluate statement:\n\n      `await page.evaluate(() => {debugger;});`\n\n       The test will now stop executing in the above evaluate statement, and chromium will stop in debug mode.\n\n5. Use debugger in node.js\n\n    This will let you debug test code. For example, you can step over `await page.click()` in the node.js script and see the click happen in the application code browser.\n\n    Note that you won't be able to run `await page.click()` in\n    DevTools console due to this [Chromium bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=833928). So if\n    you want to try something out, you have to add it to your test file.\n\n    - Add `debugger;` to your test, eg:\n      ```\n      debugger;\n      await page.click('a[target=_blank]');\n      ```\n    - Set `headless` to `false`\n    - Run `node --inspect-brk`, eg `node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest tests`\n    - In Chrome open `chrome://inspect/#devices` and click `inspect`\n    - In the newly opened test browser, type `F8` to resume test execution\n    - Now your `debugger` will be hit and you can debug in the test browser\n\n\n6. Enable verbose logging - internal DevTools protocol traffic\n   will be logged via the [`debug`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module under the `puppeteer` namespace.\n\n        # Basic verbose logging\n        env DEBUG=\"puppeteer:*\" node script.js\n\n        # Protocol traffic can be rather noisy. This example filters out all Network domain messages\n        env DEBUG=\"puppeteer:*\" env DEBUG_COLORS=true node script.js 2>&1 | grep -v '\"Network'\n\n7. Debug your Puppeteer (node) code easily, using [ndb](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ndb)\n\n  - `npm install -g ndb` (or even better, use [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx)!)\n\n  - add a `debugger` to your Puppeteer (node) code\n\n  - add `ndb` (or `npx ndb`) before your test command. For example:\n\n    `ndb jest` or `ndb mocha` (or `npx ndb jest` / `npx ndb mocha`)\n\n  - debug your test inside chromium like a boss!\n\n\n<!-- [END debugging] -->\n\n## Contributing to Puppeteer\n\nCheck out [contributing guide](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get an overview of Puppeteer development.\n\n<!-- [START faq] -->\n\n# FAQ\n\n#### Q: Who maintains Puppeteer?\n\nThe Chrome DevTools team maintains the library, but we'd love your help and expertise on the project!\nSee [Contributing](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n#### Q: What are Puppeteer’s goals and principles?\n\nThe goals of the project are:\n\n- Provide a slim, canonical library that highlights the capabilities of the [DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).\n- Provide a reference implementation for similar testing libraries. Eventually, these other frameworks could adopt Puppeteer as their foundational layer.\n- Grow the adoption of headless/automated browser testing.\n- Help dogfood new DevTools Protocol features...and catch bugs!\n- Learn more about the pain points of automated browser testing and help fill those gaps.\n\nWe adapt [Chromium principles](https://www.chromium.org/developers/core-principles) to help us drive product decisions:\n- **Speed**: Puppeteer has almost zero performance overhead over an automated page.\n- **Security**: Puppeteer operates off-process with respect to Chromium, making it safe to automate potentially malicious pages.\n- **Stability**: Puppeteer should not be flaky and should not leak memory.\n- **Simplicity**: Puppeteer provides a high-level API that’s easy to use, understand, and debug.\n\n#### Q: Is Puppeteer replacing Selenium/WebDriver?\n\n**No**. Both projects are valuable for very different reasons:\n- Selenium/WebDriver focuses on cross-browser automation; its value proposition is a single standard API that works across all major browsers.\n- Puppeteer focuses on Chromium; its value proposition is richer functionality and higher reliability.\n\nThat said, you **can** use Puppeteer to run tests against Chromium, e.g. using the community-driven [jest-puppeteer](https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer). While this probably shouldn’t be your only testing solution, it does have a few good points compared to WebDriver:\n\n- Puppeteer requires zero setup and comes bundled with the Chromium version it works best with, making it [very easy to start with](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/#getting-started). At the end of the day, it’s better to have a few tests running chromium-only, than no tests at all.\n- Puppeteer has event-driven architecture, which removes a lot of potential flakiness. There’s no need for evil “sleep(1000)” calls in puppeteer scripts.\n- Puppeteer runs headless by default, which makes it fast to run. Puppeteer v1.5.0 also exposes browser contexts, making it possible to efficiently parallelize test execution.\n- Puppeteer shines when it comes to debugging: flip the “headless” bit to false, add “slowMo”, and you’ll see what the browser is doing. You can even open Chrome DevTools to inspect the test environment.\n\n#### Q: Why doesn’t Puppeteer v.XXX work with Chromium v.YYY?\n\nWe see Puppeteer as an **indivisible entity** with Chromium. Each version of Puppeteer bundles a specific version of Chromium – **the only** version it is guaranteed to work with.\n\nThis is not an artificial constraint: A lot of work on Puppeteer is actually taking place in the Chromium repository. Here’s a typical story:\n- A Puppeteer bug is reported: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/2709\n- It turned out this is an issue with the DevTools protocol, so we’re fixing it in Chromium: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1102154\n- Once the upstream fix is landed, we roll updated Chromium into Puppeteer: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/pull/2769\n\nHowever, oftentimes it is desirable to use Puppeteer with the official Google Chrome rather than Chromium. For this to work, you should install a `puppeteer-core` version that corresponds to the Chrome version.\n\nFor example, in order to drive Chrome 71 with puppeteer-core, use `chrome-71` npm tag:\n```bash\nnpm install puppeteer-core@chrome-71\n```\n\n#### Q: Which Chromium version does Puppeteer use?\n\nLook for `chromium_revision` in [package.json](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/package.json). To find the corresponding Chromium commit and version number, search for the revision prefixed by an `r` in [OmahaProxy](https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/)'s \"Find Releases\" section.\n\n#### Q: What’s considered a “Navigation”?\n\nFrom Puppeteer’s standpoint, **“navigation” is anything that changes a page’s URL**.\nAside from regular navigation where the browser hits the network to fetch a new document from the web server, this includes [anchor navigations](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#scroll-to-fragid) and [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) usage.\n\nWith this definition of “navigation,” **Puppeteer works seamlessly with single-page applications.**\n\n#### Q: What’s the difference between a “trusted\" and \"untrusted\" input event?\n\nIn browsers, input events could be divided into two big groups: trusted vs. untrusted.\n\n- **Trusted events**: events generated by users interacting with the page, e.g. using a mouse or keyboard.\n- **Untrusted event**: events generated by Web APIs, e.g. `document.createEvent` or `element.click()` methods.\n\nWebsites can distinguish between these two groups:\n- using an [`Event.isTrusted`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted) event flag\n- sniffing for accompanying events. For example, every trusted `'click'` event is preceded by `'mousedown'` and `'mouseup'` events.\n\nFor automation purposes it’s important to generate trusted events. **All input events generated with Puppeteer are trusted and fire proper accompanying events.** If, for some reason, one needs an untrusted event, it’s always possible to hop into a page context with `page.evaluate` and generate a fake event:\n\n```js\nawait page.evaluate(() => {\n  document.querySelector('button[type=submit]').click();\n});\n```\n\n#### Q: What features does Puppeteer not support?\n\nYou may find that Puppeteer does not behave as expected when controlling pages that incorporate audio and video. (For example, [video playback/screenshots is likely to fail](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/291).) There are two reasons for this:\n\n* Puppeteer is bundled with Chromium — not Chrome — and so by default, it inherits all of [Chromium's media-related limitations](https://www.chromium.org/audio-video). This means that Puppeteer does not support licensed formats such as AAC or H.264. (However, it is possible to force Puppeteer to use a separately-installed version Chrome instead of Chromium via the [`executablePath` option to `puppeteer.launch`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.20.0/docs/api.md#puppeteerlaunchoptions). You should only use this configuration if you need an official release of Chrome that supports these media formats.)\n* Since Puppeteer (in all configurations) controls a desktop version of Chromium/Chrome, features that are only supported by the mobile version of Chrome are not supported. This means that Puppeteer [does not support HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)](https://caniuse.com/#feat=http-live-streaming).\n\n#### Q: I am having trouble installing / running Puppeteer in my test environment. Where should I look for help?\nWe have a [troubleshooting](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md) guide for various operating systems that lists the required dependencies.\n\n#### Q: How do I try/test a prerelease version of Puppeteer?\n\nYou can check out this repo or install the latest prerelease from npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save puppeteer@next\n```\n\nPlease note that prerelease may be unstable and contain bugs.\n\n#### Q: I have more questions! Where do I ask?\n\nThere are many ways to get help on Puppeteer:\n- [bugtracker](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues)\n- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/puppeteer)\n- [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/puppeteer/shared_invite/enQtMzU4MjIyMDA5NTM4LTM1OTdkNDhlM2Y4ZGUzZDdjYjM5ZWZlZGFiZjc4MTkyYTVlYzIzYjU5NDIyNzgyMmFiNDFjN2UzNWU0N2ZhZDc)\n\nMake sure to search these channels before posting your question.\n\n\n<!-- [END faq] -->\n",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
