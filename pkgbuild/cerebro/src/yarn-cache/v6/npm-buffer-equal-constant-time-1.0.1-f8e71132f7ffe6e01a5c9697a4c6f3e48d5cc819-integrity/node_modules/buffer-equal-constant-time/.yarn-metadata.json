Should work with browserify too.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/buffer-equal-constant-time.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/buffer-equal-constant-time)\n\n```sh\n  npm install buffer-equal-constant-time\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n```js\n  var bufferEq = require('buffer-equal-constant-time');\n\n  var a = new Buffer('asdf');\n  var b = new Buffer('asdf');\n  if (bufferEq(a,b)) {\n    // the same!\n  } else {\n    // different in at least one byte!\n  }\n```\n\nIf you'd like to install an `.equal()` method onto the node.js `Buffer` and\n`SlowBuffer` prototypes:\n\n```js\n  require('buffer-equal-constant-time').install();\n\n  var a = new Buffer('asdf');\n  var b = new Buffer('asdf');\n  if (a.equal(b)) {\n    // the same!\n  } else {\n    // different in at least one byte!\n  }\n```\n\nTo get rid of the installed `.equal()` method, call `.restore()`:\n\n```js\n  require('buffer-equal-constant-time').restore();\n```\n\n# Legal\n\n&copy; 2013 GoInstant Inc., a salesforce.com company\n\nLicensed under the BSD 3-clause license.\n",
