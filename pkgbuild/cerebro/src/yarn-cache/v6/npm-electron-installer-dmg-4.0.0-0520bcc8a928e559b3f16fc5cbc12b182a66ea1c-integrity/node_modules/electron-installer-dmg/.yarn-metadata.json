[Default: `process.cwd()`].\n  --icon=<path>        Path to the icon file that will be the app icon in the DMG window.\n  --icon-size=<px>     How big to make the icon for the app in the DMG. [Default: `80`].\n  --background=<path>  Path to a PNG image to use as the background of the DMG. [Size: 658 x 498]\n  --title=<string>     The title of the produced DMG, which will be shown when mounted.\n  --debug              Enable debug messages.\n  --overwrite          Overwrite any existing DMG.\n  -h --help            Show this screen.\n  --version            Show version.\n```\n\n### API\n\n```javascript\nconst createDMG = require('electron-installer-dmg');\n\nasync function buildDMG() {\n  await createDMG({\n    appPath: '/path/to/app.app',\n    name: 'MyApp'\n  });\n}\n```\n#### createDMG(opts, callback)\n\n##### `opts`\n\n`appPath` - *String* - **Required**\nThe `.app` directory generated by [electron-packager][electron-packager].\n\n`name` - *String* - **Required**\nThe application name.\n\n`title` - *String*\nThe title of the produced DMG, which will be shown when mounted.\n\n`background` - *String*\nPath to the background for the DMG window. Background image should be of size 658 × 498.\n\n`icon` - *String*\nPath to the icon to use for the app in the DMG window.\n\n`overwrite` - *Boolean*\nOverwrite an existing DMG file if if already exists.\n\n`debug` - *Boolean*\nEnable debug message output.\n\n`out` - *String*\nThe directory to put the DMG into. [Default: `process.cwd()`].\n\n`iconSize` - *Number*\nHow big to make the icon for the app in the DMG. [Default: `80`].\n\n`contents` - *Array* or *Function* that returns an Array of objects.\nThe content that will appear in the window when user opens the `.dmg` file.\n[Default: Array of two icons, application and application destination folder].\nArray example:\n```javascript\n[ { x: 448, y: 344, type: 'link', path: '/Applications'},\n  { x: 192, y: 344, type: 'file', path: '/path/to/application.app'} ]\n```\nFunction example (more flexible for getting useful options used in creating a DMG):\n```javascript\nfunction (opts) {\n   return [ { x: 448, y: 344, type: 'link', path: '/Applications'},\n            { x: 192, y: 344, type: 'file', path: opts.appPath} ];\n}\n```\n\n`format` - *String*\nDisk image format. [Default: `UDZO`].\n\n[Must be one of the following][spec]:\n\n- `UDRW` :arrow_right: read/write image\n- `UDRO` :arrow_right: read-only image\n- `UDCO` :arrow_right: ADC-compressed image\n- `UDZO` :arrow_right: zlib-compressed image\n- `UDBZ` :arrow_right: bzip2-compressed image\n- `ULFO` :arrow_right: lzfse-compressed image (macOS 10.11+ only)\n\n`additionalDMGOptions` - *Object*\nAdditional options to pass through to [`appdmg`](https://npm.im/appdmg)\n\nYou can use this to set additional features like `background-color` and\n`code-sign`.  See the docs of the `appdmg` module for all possible options.\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0\n\n[actions_img]: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-installer-dmg/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg\n[actions_url]: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-installer-dmg/actions/workflows/ci.yml\n[npm_img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/electron-installer-dmg.svg\n[npm_url]: https://npm.im/electron-installer-dmg\n[electron-packager]: https://github.com/electron/electron-packager\n[appdmg]: https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg\n[spec]: https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg#specification\n",
