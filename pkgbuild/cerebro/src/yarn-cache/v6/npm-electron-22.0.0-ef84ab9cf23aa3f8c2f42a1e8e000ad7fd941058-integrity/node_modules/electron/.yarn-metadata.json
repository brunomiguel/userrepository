It is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and\n[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) and is used by the [Atom\neditor](https://github.com/atom/atom) and many other [apps](https://electronjs.org/apps).\n\nFollow [@electronjs](https://twitter.com/electronjs) on Twitter for important\nannouncements.\n\nThis project adheres to the Contributor Covenant\n[code of conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable\nbehavior to [coc@electronjs.org](mailto:coc@electronjs.org).\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install prebuilt Electron binaries, use [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/).\nThe preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your\napp:\n\n```sh\nnpm install electron --save-dev\n```\n\nFor more installation options and troubleshooting tips, see\n[installation](docs/tutorial/installation.md). For info on how to manage Electron versions in your apps, see\n[Electron versioning](docs/tutorial/electron-versioning.md).\n\n## Platform support\n\nEach Electron release provides binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\n* macOS (High Sierra and up): Electron provides 64-bit Intel and ARM binaries for macOS. Apple Silicon support was added in Electron 11.\n* Windows (Windows 7 and up): Electron provides `ia32` (`x86`), `x64` (`amd64`), and `arm64` binaries for Windows. Windows on ARM support was added in Electron 5.0.8.\n* Linux: The prebuilt binaries of Electron are built on Ubuntu 20.04. They have also been verified to work on:\n  * Ubuntu 14.04 and newer\n  * Fedora 24 and newer\n  * Debian 8 and newer\n\n## Quick start & Electron Fiddle\n\nUse [`Electron Fiddle`](https://github.com/electron/fiddle)\nto build, run, and package small Electron experiments, to see code examples for all of Electron's APIs, and\nto try out different versions of Electron. It's designed to make the start of your journey with\nElectron easier.\n\nAlternatively, clone and run the\n[electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)\nrepository to see a minimal Electron app in action:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start\ncd electron-quick-start\nnpm install\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Resources for learning Electron\n\n* [electronjs.org/docs](https://electronjs.org/docs) - All of Electron's documentation\n* [electron/fiddle](https://github.com/electron/fiddle) - A tool to build, run, and package small Electron experiments\n* [electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) - A very basic starter Electron app\n* [electronjs.org/community#boilerplates](https://electronjs.org/community#boilerplates) - Sample starter apps created by the community\n\n## Programmatic usage\n\nMost people use Electron from the command line, but if you require `electron` inside\nyour **Node app** (not your Electron app) it will return the file path to the\nbinary. Use this to spawn Electron from Node scripts:\n\n```javascript\nconst electron = require('electron')\nconst proc = require('child_process')\n\n// will print something similar to /Users/maf/.../Electron\nconsole.log(electron)\n\n// spawn Electron\nconst child = proc.spawn(electron)\n```\n\n### Mirrors\n\n* [China](https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/)\n\nSee the [Advanced Installation Instructions](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/installation#mirror) to learn how to use a custom mirror.\n\n## Documentation translations\n\nWe crowdsource translations for our documentation via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/electron).\nWe currently accept translations for Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Japanese, Portuguese,\nRussian, and Spanish.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are interested in reporting/fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on what we're looking for and how to get started.\n\n## Community\n\nInfo on reporting bugs, getting help, finding third-party tools and sample apps,\nand more can be found on the [Community page](https://www.electronjs.org/community).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\nWhen using Electron logos, make sure to follow [OpenJS Foundation Trademark Policy](https://openjsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2021/01/OpenJS-Foundation-Trademark-Policy-2021-01-12.docx.pdf).\n",
