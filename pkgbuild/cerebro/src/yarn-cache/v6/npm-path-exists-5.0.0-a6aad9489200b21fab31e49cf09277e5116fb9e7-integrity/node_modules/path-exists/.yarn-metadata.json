    "readme": "# path-exists\n\n> Check if a path exists\n\nNOTE: `fs.existsSync` has been un-deprecated in Node.js since 6.8.0. If you only need to check synchronously, this module is not needed.\n\nNever use this before handling a file though:\n\n> In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to `fs.exists()` and `fs.open()`. Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install path-exists\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\n// foo.js\nimport {pathExists} from 'path-exists';\n\nconsole.log(await pathExists('foo.js'));\n//=> true\n```\n\n## API\n\n### pathExists(path)\n\nReturns a `Promise<boolean>` of whether the path exists.\n\n### pathExistsSync(path)\n\nReturns a `boolean` of whether the path exists.\n\n## Related\n\n- [path-exists-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/path-exists-cli) - CLI for this module\n- [path-type](https://github.com/sindresorhus/path-type) - Check if a path exists and whether it's a file, directory, or symlink\n\n---\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\t<b>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/npm-path-exists?utm_source=npm-path-exists&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme\">Get professional support for this package with a Tidelift subscription</a>\n\t</b>\n\t<br>\n\t<sub>\n\t\tTidelift helps make open source sustainable for maintainers while giving companies<br>assurances about security, maintenance, and licensing for their dependencies.\n\t</sub>\n</div>\n",
