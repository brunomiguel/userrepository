Port of python's [argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html) (version [3.9.0](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0rc1/Lib/argparse.py)).\n\n**Difference with original.**\n\n- JS has no keyword arguments support.\n  -  Pass options instead: `new ArgumentParser({ description: 'example', add_help: true })`.\n- JS has no python's types `int`, `float`, ...\n  - Use string-typed names: `.add_argument('-b', { type: 'int', help: 'help' })`.\n- `%r` format specifier uses `require('util').inspect()`.\n\nMore details in [doc](./doc).\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n`test.js` file:\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n'use strict';\n\nconst { ArgumentParser } = require('argparse');\nconst { version } = require('./package.json');\n\nconst parser = new ArgumentParser({\n  description: 'Argparse example'\n});\n\nparser.add_argument('-v', '--version', { action: 'version', version });\nparser.add_argument('-f', '--foo', { help: 'foo bar' });\nparser.add_argument('-b', '--bar', { help: 'bar foo' });\nparser.add_argument('--baz', { help: 'baz bar' });\n\nconsole.dir(parser.parse_args());\n```\n\nDisplay help:\n\n```\n$ ./test.js -h\nusage: test.js [-h] [-v] [-f FOO] [-b BAR] [--baz BAZ]\n\nArgparse example\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help         show this help message and exit\n  -v, --version      show program's version number and exit\n  -f FOO, --foo FOO  foo bar\n  -b BAR, --bar BAR  bar foo\n  --baz BAZ          baz bar\n```\n\nParse arguments:\n\n```\n$ ./test.js -f=3 --bar=4 --baz 5\n{ foo: '3', bar: '4', baz: '5' }\n```\n\n\nAPI docs\n--------\n\nSince this is a port with minimal divergence, there's no separate documentation.\nUse original one instead, with notes about difference.\n\n1.

    "licenseText": "A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible? (1)\n\n    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.
