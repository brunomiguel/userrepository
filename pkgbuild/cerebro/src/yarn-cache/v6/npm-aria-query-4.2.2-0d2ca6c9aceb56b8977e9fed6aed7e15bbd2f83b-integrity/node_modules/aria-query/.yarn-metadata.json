    "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/A11yance/aria-query.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/A11yance/aria-query)\n\nCDN URL: https://npm-cdn.com/pkg/aria-query/\n\n# ARIA Query\n\nProgrammatic access to the [WAI-ARIA 1.1 Roles Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#roles).\n\n## Building the `src/etc` files.\n\nThe files under `src/etc` are generated by the `breakUpAriaJSON` script.\n\nTo change them, edit the file `scripts/roles.json` then run:\n\n```\n$ node ./scripts/breakUpAriaJSON.js\n$ git add scripts/roles.json src/etc\n```\n\nIt should work with Node version 6.11.2 or later.\n\n## Utilities\n\n### Roles\n\n```\nimport { roles } from 'aria-query';\n```\n\nA [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) of\nrole names to the role definition. For example:\n\n```\nlet alertRole = roles.get('alert');\n/**\n * Value of alertRole\n * {\n *   \"requiredProps\": {},\n *   \"props\": {\n *     \"aria-atomic\": \"true\",\n *     \"aria-busy\": null,\n *     \"aria-controls\": null,\n *     \"aria-current\": null,\n *     \"aria-describedby\": null,\n *     \"aria-details\": null,\n *     \"aria-disabled\": null,\n *     \"aria-dropeffect\": null,\n *     \"aria-errormessage\": null,\n *     \"aria-expanded\": null,\n *     \"aria-flowto\": null,\n *     \"aria-grabbed\": null,\n *     \"aria-haspopup\": null,\n *     \"aria-hidden\": null,\n *     \"aria-invalid\": null,\n *     \"aria-keyshortcuts\": null,\n *     \"aria-label\": null,\n *     \"aria-labelledby\": null,\n *     \"aria-live\": \"assertive\",\n *     \"aria-owns\": null,\n *     \"aria-relevant\": null,\n *     \"aria-roledescription\": null\n *   },\n *   \"abstract\": false,\n *   \"childrenPresentational\": false,\n *   \"baseConcepts\": [],\n *   \"relatedConcepts\": [ {\n *     \"module\": \"XForms\",\n *     \"concept\": {\n *       \"name\": \"alert\"\n *     }\n *   }],\n *   \"superClass\": [[\"roletype\", \"structure\", \"section\"]]\n * }\n```\n\n### Elements to Roles\n\n```\nimport { elementRoles } from 'aria-query';\n```\n\nHTML Elements with inherent roles are mapped to those roles. In the case of an element like `<input>`, the element often requires a `type` attribute to map to an ARIA role.\n\n```\nMap {\n  '{\"name\": \"article\"}' => Set { 'article' },\n  '{\"name\": \"button\"}' => Set { 'button' },\n  '{\"name\": \"td\"}' => Set { 'cell', 'gridcell' },\n  '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"checkbox\"}] }' => Set { 'checkbox' },\n  '{\"name\": \"th\"}' => Set { 'columnheader' },\n  '{\"name\": \"select\"}' => Set { 'combobox', 'listbox' },\n  '{\"name\": \"menuitem\"}' => Set { 'command', 'menuitem' },\n  '{\"name\": \"dd\"}' => Set { 'definition' },\n  '{\"name\": \"dfn\"}' => Set { 'definition' },\n  '{\"name\": \"figure\"}' => Set { 'figure' },\n  '{\"name\": \"form\"}' => Set { 'form' },\n  '{\"name\": \"table\"}' => Set { 'grid', 'table' },\n  '{\"name\": \"fieldset\"}' => Set { 'group' },\n  '{\"name\": \"h1\"}' => Set { 'heading' },\n  '{\"name\": \"h2\"}' => Set { 'heading' },\n  '{\"name\": \"h3\"}' => Set { 'heading' },\n  '{\"name\": \"h4\"}' => Set { 'heading' },\n  '{\"name\": \"h5\"}' => Set { 'heading' },\n  '{\"name\": \"h6\"}' => Set { 'heading' },\n  '{\"name\": \"img\"}' => Set { 'img' },\n  '{\"name\": \"a\"}' => Set { 'link' },\n  '{\"name\": \"link\"}' => Set { 'link' },\n  '{\"name\": \"ol\"}' => Set { 'list' },\n  '{\"name\": \"ul\"}' => Set { 'list' },\n  '{\"name\": \"li\"}' => Set { 'listitem' },\n  '{\"name\": \"nav\"}' => Set { 'navigation' },\n  '{\"name\": \"option\"}' => Set { 'option' },\n  '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"radio\"}] }' => Set { 'radio' },\n  '{\"name\": \"frame\"}' => Set { 'region' },\n  '{\"name\": \"rel\"}' => Set { 'roletype' },\n  '{\"name\": \"tr\"}' => Set { 'row' },\n  '{\"name\": \"tbody\"}' => Set { 'rowgroup' },\n  '{\"name\": \"tfoot\"}' => Set { 'rowgroup' },\n  '{\"name\": \"thead\"}' => Set { 'rowgroup' },\n  '{\"name\": \"th\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"scope\", \"value\": \"row\"}] }' => Set { 'rowheader' },\n  '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"search\"}] }' => Set { 'searchbox' },\n  '{\"name\": \"hr\"}' => Set { 'separator' },\n  '{\"name\": \"dt\"}' => Set { 'term' },\n  '{\"name\": \"textarea\"}' => Set { 'textbox' },\n  '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"text\"}] }' => Set { 'textbox' }\n}\n```\n\nThe map of elements to roles is keyed by an HTML concept. An HTML concept corresponds to the `baseConcepts` and `relatedConcepts` of an ARIA role. Concepts exist in the context of a `module`: HTML, XForms, Dublin Core, for example.  The concept representation is an object literal with a name property (the element name) and an optional attributes array.\n\nThe roles are provided in a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set).\n\n### Role to element\n\n```\nimport { roleElements } from 'aria-query';\n```\n\nARIA roles are mapped to the HTML Elements with the same inherent role. Some roles, such as `columnheader` are only mapped to an HMTL element that expresses specific attributes. In the case of `<input>`, the element often requires a `type` attribute to map to an ARIA role.\n\n```\nMap {\n  'article' => Set { '{\"name\": \"article\"}' },\n  'button' => Set { '{\"name\": \"button\"}' },\n  'cell' => Set { '{\"name\": \"td\"}' },\n  'checkbox' => Set { '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"checkbox\"}] }' },\n  'columnheader' => Set { '{\"name\": \"th\"}' },\n  'combobox' => Set { '{\"name\": \"select\"}' },\n  'command' => Set { '{\"name\": \"menuitem\"}' },\n  'definition' => Set { '{\"name\": \"dd\"}', '{\"name\": \"dfn\"}' },\n  'figure' => Set { '{\"name\": \"figure\"}' },\n  'form' => Set { '{\"name\": \"form\"}' },\n  'grid' => Set { '{\"name\": \"table\"}' },\n  'gridcell' => Set { '{\"name\": \"td\"}' },\n  'group' => Set { '{\"name\": \"fieldset\"}' },\n  'heading' => Set { '{\"name\": \"h1\"}', '{\"name\": \"h2\"}', '{\"name\": \"h3\"}', '{\"name\": \"h4\"}',  '{\"name\": \"h5\"}', '{\"name\": \"h6\"}' },\n  'img' => Set { '{\"name\": \"img\"}' },\n  'link' => Set { '{\"name\": \"a\"}', '{\"name\": \"link\"}' },\n  'list' => Set { '{\"name\": \"ol\"}', '{\"name\": \"ul\"}' },\n  'listbox' => Set { '{\"name\": \"select\"}' },\n  'listitem' => Set { '{\"name\": \"li\"}' },\n  'menuitem' => Set { '{\"name\": \"menuitem\"}' },\n  'navigation' => Set { '{\"name\": \"nav\"}' },\n  'option' => Set { '{\"name\": \"option\"}' },\n  'radio' => Set { '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"radio\"}] }' },\n  'region' => Set { '{\"name\": \"frame\"}' },\n  'roletype' => Set { '{\"name\": \"rel\"}' },\n  'row' => Set { '{\"name\": \"tr\"}' },\n  'rowgroup' => Set { '{\"name\": \"tbody\"}', '{\"name\": \"tfoot\"}', '{\"name\": \"thead\"}' },\n  'rowheader' => Set { '{\"name\": \"th\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"scope\", \"value\": \"row\"}] }' },\n  'searchbox' => Set { '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"search\"}] }' },\n  'separator' => Set { '{\"name\": \"hr\"}' },\n  'table' => Set { '{\"name\": \"table\"}' },\n  'term' => Set { '{\"name\": \"dt\"}' },\n  'textbox' => Set { '{\"name\": \"textarea\"}', '{\"name\": \"input\", \"attributes\": [ {\"name\": \"type\", \"value\": \"text\"}] }' }\n}\n```\n\nThe HTML concept values are provided in a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set).\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2020 A11yance\n",
