    "readme": "Port of the OpenBSD `bcrypt_pbkdf` function to pure Javascript. `npm`-ified\nversion of [Devi Mandiri's port](https://github.com/devi/tmp/blob/master/js/bcrypt_pbkdf.js),\nwith some minor performance improvements. The code is copied verbatim (and\nun-styled) from Devi's work.\n\nThis product includes software developed by Niels Provos.\n\n## API\n\n### `bcrypt_pbkdf.pbkdf(pass, passlen, salt, saltlen, key, keylen, rounds)`\n\nDerive a cryptographic key of arbitrary length from a given password and salt,\nusing the OpenBSD `bcrypt_pbkdf` function. This is a combination of Blowfish and\nSHA-512.\n\nSee [this article](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/bcrypt-pbkdf) for\nfurther information.\n\nParameters:\n\n * `pass`, a Uint8Array of length `passlen`\n * `passlen`, an integer Number\n * `salt`, a Uint8Array of length `saltlen`\n * `saltlen`, an integer Number\n * `key`, a Uint8Array of length `keylen`, will be filled with output\n * `keylen`, an integer Number\n * `rounds`, an integer Number, number of rounds of the PBKDF to run\n\n### `bcrypt_pbkdf.hash(sha2pass, sha2salt, out)`\n\nCalculate a Blowfish hash, given SHA2-512 output of a password and salt. Used as\npart of the inner round function in the PBKDF.\n\nParameters:\n\n * `sha2pass`, a Uint8Array of length 64\n * `sha2salt`, a Uint8Array of length 64\n * `out`, a Uint8Array of length 32, will be filled with output\n\n## License\n\nThis source form is a 1:1 port from the OpenBSD `blowfish.c` and `bcrypt_pbkdf.c`.\nAs a result, it retains the original copyright and license. The two files are\nunder slightly different (but compatible) licenses, and are here combined in\none file. For each of the full license texts see `LICENSE`.\n",
