This plugin fixes that. Example output:\n\n> ERROR in ./src/containers/SearchProducts.js\n  Module not found: Error: [CaseSensitivePathsPlugin] `/Users/example/yourproject/src/components/searchProducts/searchproducts.js` does not match the corresponding path on disk `/Users/example/yourproject/src/components/searchproducts`\n   @ ./src/containers/SearchProducts.js 9:22-84\n\nInstall\n----\n    npm install --save-dev case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin\n\nUsage\n----\n\n```JavaScript\nvar CaseSensitivePathsPlugin = require('case-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin');\n\nvar webpackConfig = {\n    plugins: [\n        new CaseSensitivePathsPlugin()\n        // other plugins ...\n    ]\n    // other webpack config ...\n}\n```\n\nWant more information? Pass ```{debug: true}``` to the plugin like so:\n\n```JavaScript\nnew CaseSensitivePathsPlugin({debug: true})\n```\n\nIt will output every directory it reads, as well as a sum total of filesystem operations.\nThis is mostly useful for internal debugging of the plugin, but if you find it useful, more power to you.\n\nDemo\n---\nCheck the `/demo` directory for a working example of the plugin in action, with tests demonstrating the effect of the plugin. See `/demo/README.md` for more.\n\nThanks & Credit\n----\n* [Daniel Cousineau](https://github.com/dcousineau) who wrote an [earlier version](https://github.com/dcousineau/force-case-sensitivity-webpack-plugin) of this case-sensitivity plugin\n* [Alexandre Kirszenberg](https://github.com/Morhaus) who's [gist](https://gist.github.com/Morhaus/333579c2a5b4db644bd5) formed the basis of both these plugins.\n* [Cameron Brewer](https://github.com/morethanfire) and [Ben Collins](https://github.com/aggieben) who added Windows support.\n* [Christian Lilley](https://github.com/xml) who added a demo/test package.\n* [Lance Eastgate](https://github.com/NorwegianKiwi) who added some internationalization support\n* [Jonathan Kim](https://github.com/jkimbo) and [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) who investigated, fixed, and added some tests for a crashing bug.\n* [Jason Quense](https://github.com/jquense) who switched it to properly use the webpack-provided fs object.\n* [Cesare Soldini](https://github.com/caesarsol) who added a test\n* [Kirill Konshin](https://github.com/kirill-konshin) who helped update to Webpack 5\n\n\n## License\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FUrthen%2Fcase-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FUrthen%2Fcase-sensitive-paths-webpack-plugin?ref=badge_large)\n",
