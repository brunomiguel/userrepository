Please keep in mind that this branch may include some work that has not yet been published as part of an official release. However, since `master` is always stable, you should feel free to build your own working release straight from master at any time.\n\nDevelopment of the next major release, version 5, happens on [the `dev` branch](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/tree/dev).\n\nIf you're interested in helping out, please read [our contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## About\n\n`history` is developed and maintained by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). If\nyou're interested in learning more about what React can do for your company, please\n[get in touch](mailto:hello@reacttraining.com)!\n\n## Thanks\n\nA big thank-you to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to run our build in real browsers.\n\nAlso, thanks to [Dan Shaw](https://www.npmjs.com/~dshaw) for letting us use the `history` npm package name. Thanks, Dan!\n",
