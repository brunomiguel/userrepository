    "readme": "# nth-check [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fb55/nth-check.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fb55/nth-check)\n\nA performant nth-check parser & compiler.\n\n### About\n\nThis module can be used to parse & compile nth-checks, as they are found in CSS 3's `nth-child()` and `nth-last-of-type()`.\n\n`nth-check` focusses on speed, providing optimized functions for different kinds of nth-child formulas, while still following the [spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo).\n\n### API\n\n```js\nvar nthCheck = require(\"nth-check\");\n```\n\n##### `nthCheck(formula)`\n\nFirst parses, then compiles the formula.\n\n##### `nthCheck.parse(formula)`\n\nParses the expression, throws a `SyntaxError` if it fails, otherwise returns an array containing two elements.\n\n__Example:__\n\n```js\nnthCheck.parse(\"2n+3\") //[2, 3]\n```\n\n##### `nthCheck.compile([a, b])`\n\nTakes an array with two elements (as returned by `.parse`) and returns a highly optimized function.\n\nIf the formula doesn't match any elements, it returns [`boolbase`](https://github.com/fb55/boolbase)'s `falseFunc`, otherwise, a function accepting an _index_ is returned, which returns whether or not a passed _index_ matches the formula. (Note: The spec starts counting at `1`, the returned function at `0`).\n\n__Example:__\n```js\nvar check = nthCheck.compile([2, 3]);\n\ncheck(0) //false\ncheck(1) //false\ncheck(2) //true\ncheck(3) //false\ncheck(4) //true\ncheck(5) //false\ncheck(6) //true\n```\n\n---\nLicense: BSD\n",
