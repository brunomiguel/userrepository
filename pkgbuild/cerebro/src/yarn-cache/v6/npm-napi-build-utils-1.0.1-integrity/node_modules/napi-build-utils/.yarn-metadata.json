Other functions determine whether a particular N-API version can be built and can issue console warnings for unsupported N-API versions. \n\nUnlike the modules this code is designed to facilite building, this module is written entirely in JavaScript. \n\n## Quick start\n\n```bash\n$ npm install napi-build-utils\n```\n\nThe module exports a set of functions documented [here](./index.md). For exmaple:\n\n```javascript\nvar napiBuildUtils = require('napi-build-utils');\nvar napiVersion = napiBuildUtils.getNapiVersion(); // N-API version supported by Node, or undefined.\n```\n\n## Declaring supported N-API versions\n\nNative modules that are designed to work with [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api) must explicitly declare the N-API version(s) against which they are coded to build. This is accomplished by including a `binary.napi_versions` property in the module's `package.json` file. For example:\n\n```json\n\"binary\": {\n  \"napi_versions\": [2,3]\n}\n``` \n\nIn the absence of a need to compile against a specific N-API version, the value `3` is a good choice as this is the N-API version that was supported when N-API left experimental status. \n\nModules that are built against a specific N-API version will continue to operate indefinitely, even as later versions of N-API are introduced. \n\n## Support\n\nIf you run into problems or limitations, please file an issue and we'll take a look. Pull requests are also welcome.  \n",
