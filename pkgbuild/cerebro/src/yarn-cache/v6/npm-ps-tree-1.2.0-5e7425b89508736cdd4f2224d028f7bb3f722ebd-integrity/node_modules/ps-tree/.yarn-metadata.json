If the parent terminates, however, all it's children have assigned as their new parent the init process. Thus, the children still have a parent to collect their status and execution statistics.\n> (from \"operating system concepts\")\n\nSolution: use `ps-tree` to get all processes that a `child_process` may have started, so that they may all be terminated.\n\n``` js\nvar cp = require('child_process'),\n    psTree = require('ps-tree');\n\nvar child = cp.exec(\"node -e 'while (true);'\", function () {...});\n\n// This will not actually kill the child it will kill the `sh` process.\nchild.kill();\n```\n\nwtf? it's because exec actually works like this:\n\n``` js\nfunction exec (cmd, cb) {\n  spawn('sh', ['-c', cmd]);\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n`sh` starts parses the command string and starts processes, and waits for them to terminate, but `exec` returns a process object with the pid of the `sh` process.\nHowever, since it is in `wait` mode killing it does not kill the children.\n\nUse `ps-tree` like this:\n\n``` js\nvar cp = require('child_process'),\n    psTree = require('ps-tree');\n\nvar child = cp.exec(\"node -e 'while (true);'\", function () { /*...*/ });\n\npsTree(child.pid, function (err, children) {\n  cp.spawn('kill', ['-9'].concat(children.map(function (p) { return p.PID })));\n});\n```\n\nIf you prefer to run **psTree** from the command line, use: `node ./bin/ps-tree.js`\n\n## Cross Platform support\n\n\nThe `ps-tree` module behaves differently on *nix vs. Windows by spawning different programs and parsing their output. This is based on `process.platform` and not on checking to see if a `ps` compatible program exists on the system.\n\n#### *nix\n\n1. \" <defunct> \" need to be striped\n```bash\n$ ps -A -o comm,ppid,pid,stat\nCOMMAND          PPID   PID STAT\nbbsd             2899 16958 Ss\nwatch <defunct>  1914 16964 Z\nps              20688 16965 R+\n```\n\n### Windows\n1. `wmic PROCESS WHERE ParentProcessId=4604 GET Name,ParentProcessId,ProcessId,Status)`\n2. The order of head columns is fixed\n```shell\n> wmic PROCESS GET Name,ProcessId,ParentProcessId,Status\nName                          ParentProcessId  ProcessId   Status\nSystem Idle Process           0                0\nSystem                        0                4\nsmss.exe                      4                228\n```\n\n### LICENSE: MIT\n",
