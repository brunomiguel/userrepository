Thanks\nto\n\n-   [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) for his explanations\n    about character encodings, and his library `he`, which was one of the\n    inspirations for `entities`\n-   [@inikulin](https://github.com/inikulin) for his work on optimized tries for\n    decoding HTML entities for the `parse5` project\n-   [@mdevils](https://github.com/mdevils) for taking on the challenge of\n    producing a quick entity library with his `html-entities` library.\n    `entities` would be quite a bit slower if there wasn't any competition.\n    Right now `entities` is on top, but we'll see how long that lasts!\n\n---\n\nLicense: BSD-2-Clause\n\n## Security contact information\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).
