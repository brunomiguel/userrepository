Learn more about DASH IF Reference Client on our [wiki](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki).\n\nIf your intent is to use the player code without contributing back to this project, then use the MASTER branch which holds the approved and stable public releases.\n\nIf your goal is to improve or extend the code and contribute back to this project, then you should make your changes in, and submit a pull request against, the DEVELOPMENT branch. Read our [CONTRIBUTION.md](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for a walk-through of the contribution process.\n\nAll new work should be in the development branch. Master is now reserved for tagged builds.\n\n## Demo and reference players\nAll these reference builds and minified files are available under both http and https.\n\n### Samples\nMultiple [dash.js samples](https://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/latest/samples/index.html) covering a wide set of common use cases.\n\n### Reference players\nThe released [pre-built reference players ](http://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/) if you want direct access without writing any Javascript.\n\nThe [nightly build of the /dev branch reference player](http://reference.dashif.org/dash.js/nightly/samples/dash-if-reference-player/index.html), is pre-release but contains the latest fixes. It is a good place to start if you are debugging playback problems.\n\n\n### CDN hosted files\nThe latest minified files have been hosted on a global CDN and are free to use in production:\n\n- [dash.all.min.js](http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/dash.all.min.js)\n- [dash.all.debug.js](http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/dash.all.debug.js)\n\nIn addition, all the releases are available under the following urls. Replace \"vx.x.x\" with the release version, for instance \"v3.1.0\".\n\n- [http://cdn.dashjs.org/vx.x.x/dash.all.min.js](http://cdn.dashjs.org/v3.1.0/dash.all.min.js)\n- [http://cdn.dashjs.org/vx.x.x/dash.all.debug.js](http://cdn.dashjs.org/v3.1.0/dash.all.debug.js)\n\n\n\n## Documentation\nFull [API Documentation](http://cdn.dashjs.org/latest/jsdoc/module-MediaPlayer.html) is available describing all public methods, interfaces, properties, and events.\n\nFor help, join our [Slack channel](https://dashif-slack.azurewebsites.net), our [email list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dashjs) and read our [wiki](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki).\n\n## Tutorials\n\nDetailed information on specific topics can be found in our tutorials:\n\n* [Low latency streaming](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/Low-Latency-streaming)\n* [UTCTiming Clock synchronization](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/UTCTiming---Clock-synchronization)\n* [Digital Rights Management (DRM) and license acquisition](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/Digital-Rights-Management-(DRM)-and-license-acquisition)\n* [Buffer and scheduling logic](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/wiki/Buffer-and-Scheduling-Logic)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe standard setup method uses javascript to initialize and provide video details to dash.js. `MediaPlayerFactory` provides an alternative declarative setup syntax.\n\n### Standard Setup\n\nCreate a video element somewhere in your html. For our purposes, make sure the controls attribute is present.\n```html\n<video id=\"videoPlayer\" controls></video>\n```\nAdd dash.all.min.js to the end of the body.\n```html\n<body>\n  ...\n  <script src=\"yourPathToDash/dash.all.min.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\nNow comes the good stuff. We need to create a MediaPlayer and initialize it.\n``` js\n\nvar url = \"https://dash.akamaized.net/envivio/EnvivioDash3/manifest.mpd\";\nvar player = dashjs.MediaPlayer().create();\nplayer.initialize(document.querySelector(\"#videoPlayer\"), url, true);\n\n```\n\nWhen it is all done, it should look similar to this:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Dash.js Rocks</title>\n        <style>\n            video {\n                width: 640px;\n                height: 360px;\n            }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div>\n            <video id=\"videoPlayer\" controls></video>\n        </div>\n        <script src=\"yourPathToDash/dash.all.min.js\"></script>\n        <script>\n            (function(){\n                var url = \"https://dash.akamaized.net/envivio/EnvivioDash3/manifest.mpd\";\n                var player = dashjs.MediaPlayer().create();\n                player.initialize(document.querySelector(\"#videoPlayer\"), url, true);\n            })();\n        </script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Module Setup\n\nWe publish dash.js to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dashjs). Examples of how to use dash.js in different module\nbundlers can be found in the [`samples/modules`](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/tree/development/samples/modules) directory.\n\n### MediaPlayerFactory Setup\n\nAn alternative way to build a Dash.js player in your web page is to use the MediaPlayerFactory.  The MediaPlayerFactory will automatically instantiate and initialize the MediaPlayer module on appropriately tagged video elements.\n\nCreate a video element somewhere in your html and provide the path to your `mpd` file as src. Also ensure that your video element has the `data-dashjs-player` attribute on it.\n```html\n<video data-dashjs-player autoplay src=\"https://dash.akamaized.net/envivio/EnvivioDash3/manifest.mpd\" controls>\n</video>\n\n```\n\nAdd dash.all.min.js to the end of the body.\n```html\n<body>\n  ...\n  <script src=\"yourPathToDash/dash.all.min.js\"></script>\n</body>\n```\n\nWhen it is all done, it should look similar to this:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Dash.js Rocks</title>\n        <style>\n            video {\n                width: 640px;\n                height: 360px;\n            }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div>\n            <video data-dashjs-player autoplay src=\"https://dash.akamaized.net/envivio/EnvivioDash3/manifest.mpd\" controls>\n            </video>\n        </div>\n        <script src=\"yourPathToDash/dash.all.min.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Quick Start for Developers\n\n1. Install Core Dependencies\n    * [install nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)\n2. Checkout project repository (default branch: development)\n    * ```git clone https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js.git```\n3. Install dependencies\n    * ```npm install```\n4. Build, watch file changes and launch samples page, which has links that point to reference player and to other examples (basic examples, captioning, ads, live, etc).\n    * ```npm run start```\n\n\n### Other Tasks to Build / Run Tests on Commandline.\n\n* Build distribution files (minification included)\n    * ```npm run build```\n* Build and watch distribution files \n    * ```npm run dev```\n* Run linter on source files (linter is also applied when building files)\n    * ```npm run lint```\n* Run unit tests\n    * ```npm run test```\n* Generate API jsdoc\n    * ```npm run doc```\n    \n### Troubleshooting\n* In case the build process is failing make sure to use an up-to-date node.js version. The build process was successfully tested with node.js version 14.16.1.\n\n### License\ndash.js is released under [BSD license](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/blob/development/LICENSE.md)\n\n### Tested With\n\n[<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7864462/12837037/452a17c6-cb73-11e5-9f39-fc96893bc9bf.png\" alt=\"Browser Stack Logo\" width=\"300\">](https://www.browserstack.com/)\n",
