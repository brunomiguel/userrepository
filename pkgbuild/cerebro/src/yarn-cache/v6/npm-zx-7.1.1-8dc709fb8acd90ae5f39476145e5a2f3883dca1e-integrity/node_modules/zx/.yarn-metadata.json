The `zx` package provides\nuseful wrappers around `child_process`, escapes arguments and\ngives sensible defaults.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g zx\n```\n\n**Requirement**: Node version >= 16.0.0\n\n## Goods\n\n[$](#command-) · [cd()](#cd) · [fetch()](#fetch) · [question()](#question) · [sleep()](#sleep) · [echo()](#echo) · [stdin()](#stdin) · [within()](#within) ·\n[chalk](#chalk-package) · [fs](#fs-package) · [os](#os-package) · [path](#path-package) · [glob](#globby-package) · [yaml](#yaml-package) · [minimist](#minimist-package) · [which](#which-package) ·\n[__filename](#__filename--__dirname) · [__dirname](#__filename--__dirname) · [require()](#require)\n\n## Documentation\n\nWrite your scripts in a file with an `.mjs` extension in order to\nuse `await` at the top level. If you prefer the `.js` extension,\nwrap your scripts in something like `void async function () {...}()`.\n\nAdd the following shebang to the beginning of your `zx` scripts:\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env zx\n```\n\nNow you will be able to run your script like so:\n```bash\nchmod +x ./script.mjs\n./script.mjs\n```\n\nOr via the `zx` executable:\n\n```bash\nzx ./script.mjs\n```\n\nAll functions (`$`, `cd`, `fetch`, etc) are available straight away\nwithout any imports.\n\nOr import globals explicitly (for better autocomplete in VS Code).\n\n```js\nimport 'zx/globals'\n```\n\n### ``$`command` ``\n\nExecutes a given command using the `spawn` func\nand returns [`ProcessPromise`](#processpromise).\n\nEverything passed through `${...}` will be automatically escaped and quoted.\n\n```js\nlet name = 'foo & bar'\nawait $`mkdir ${name}`\n```\n\n**There is no need to add extra quotes.** Read more about it in\n[quotes](docs/quotes.md).\n\nYou can pass an array of arguments if needed:\n\n```js\nlet flags = [\n  '--oneline',\n  '--decorate',\n  '--color',\n]\nawait $`git log ${flags}`\n```\n\nIf the executed program returns a non-zero exit code,\n[`ProcessOutput`](#processoutput) will be thrown.\n\n```js\ntry {\n  await $`exit 1`\n} catch (p) {\n  console.log(`Exit code: ${p.exitCode}`)\n  console.log(`Error: ${p.stderr}`)\n}\n```\n\n### `ProcessPromise`\n\n```ts\nclass ProcessPromise extends Promise<ProcessOutput> {\n  stdin: Writable\n  stdout: Readable\n  stderr: Readable\n  exitCode: Promise<number>\n  pipe(dest): ProcessPromise\n  kill(): Promise<void>\n  nothrow(): this\n  quiet(): this\n}\n```\n\nRead more about the [ProcessPromise](docs/process-promise.md).\n\n### `ProcessOutput`\n\n```ts\nclass ProcessOutput {\n  readonly stdout: string\n  readonly stderr: string\n  readonly signal: string\n  readonly exitCode: number\n  toString(): string // Combined stdout & stderr.\n}\n```\n\nThe output of the process is captured as-is. Usually, programs print a new line `\\n` at the end.\nIf `ProcessOutput` is used as an argument to some other `$` process,\n**zx** will use stdout and trim the new line.\n\n```js\nlet date = await $`date`\nawait $`echo Current date is ${date}.`\n```\n\n## Functions\n\n### `cd()`\n\nChanges the current working directory.\n\n```js\ncd('/tmp')\nawait $`pwd` // => /tmp\n```\n\n### `fetch()`\n\nA wrapper around the [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) package.\n\n```js\nlet resp = await fetch('https://medv.io')\n```\n\n### `question()`\n\nA wrapper around the [readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) package.\n\n```js\nlet bear = await question('What kind of bear is best? ')\n```\n\n### `sleep()`\n\nA wrapper around the `setTimeout` function.\n\n```js\nawait sleep(1000)\n```\n\n### `echo()`\n\nA `console.log()` alternative which can take [ProcessOutput](#processoutput).\n\n```js\nlet branch = await $`git branch --show-current`\n\necho`Current branch is ${branch}.`\n// or\necho('Current branch is', branch)\n```\n\n### `stdin()`\n\nReturns the stdin as a string.\n\n```js\nlet content = JSON.parse(await stdin())\n```\n\n### `within()`\n\nCreates a new async context.\n\n```js\nawait $`pwd` // => /home/path\n\nwithin(async () => {\n  cd('/tmp')\n\n  setTimeout(async () => {\n    await $`pwd` // => /tmp\n  }, 1000)\n})\n\nawait $`pwd` // => /home/path\n```\n\n```js\nlet version = await within(async () => {\n  $.prefix += 'export NVM_DIR=$HOME/.nvm; source $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh; '\n  await $`nvm use 16`\n  return $`node -v`\n})\n```\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following packages are available without importing inside scripts.\n\n### `chalk` package\n\nThe [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) package.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(chalk.blue('Hello world!'))\n```\n\n### `fs` package\n\nThe [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) package.\n\n```js\nlet {version} = await fs.readJson('./package.json')\n```\n\n### `os` package\n\nThe [os](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html) package.\n\n```js\nawait $`cd ${os.homedir()} && mkdir example`\n```\n\n### `path` package\n\nThe [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) package.\n\n```js\nawait $`mkdir ${path.join(basedir, 'output')}`\n```\n\n### `globby` package\n\nThe [globby](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby) package.\n\n```js\nlet packages = await glob(['package.json', 'packages/*/package.json'])\n```\n\n### `yaml` package\n\nThe [yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml) package.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(YAML.parse('foo: bar').foo)\n```\n\n### `minimist` package\n\nThe [minimist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist) package available\nas global const `argv`.\n\n```js\nif( argv.someFlag ){ echo('yes') }\n```\n\n### `which` package\n\nThe [which](https://github.com/npm/node-which) package.\n\n```js\nlet node = await which('node')\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### `$.shell`\n\nSpecifies what shell is used. Default is `which bash`.\n\n```js\n$.shell = '/usr/bin/bash'\n```\n\nOr use a CLI argument: `--shell=/bin/bash`\n\n### `$.spawn`\n\nSpecifies a `spawn` api. Defaults to `require('child_process').spawn`.\n\n### `$.prefix`\n\nSpecifies the command that will be prefixed to all commands run.\n\nDefault is `set -euo pipefail;`.\n\nOr use a CLI argument: `--prefix='set -e;'`\n\n### `$.quote`\n\nSpecifies a function for escaping special characters during\ncommand substitution.\n\n### `$.verbose`\n\nSpecifies verbosity. Default is `true`.\n\nIn verbose mode, `zx` prints all executed commands alongside with their\noutputs.\n\nOr use the CLI argument `--quiet` to set `$.verbose = false`.\n\n### `$.env`\n\nSpecifies an environment variables map.\n\nDefaults to `process.env`.\n\n### `$.cwd`\n\nSpecifies a current working directory of all processes created with the `$`.\n\nThe [cd()](#cd) func changes only `process.cwd()` and if no `$.cwd` specified,\nall `$` processes use `process.cwd()` by default (same as `spawn` behavior).\n\n### `$.log`\n\nSpecifies a [logging function](src/core.ts).\n\n```ts\nimport { LogEntry, log } from 'zx/core'\n\n$.log = (entry: LogEntry) => {\n  switch (entry.kind) {\n    case 'cmd':\n      // for example, apply custom data masker for cmd printing\n      process.stderr.write(masker(entry.cmd))\n      break\n    default:\n      log(entry)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Polyfills\n\n### `__filename` & `__dirname`\n\nIn [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) modules, Node.js does not provide\n`__filename` and `__dirname` globals. As such globals are really handy in scripts,\n`zx` provides these for use in `.mjs` files (when using the `zx` executable).\n\n### `require()`\n\nIn [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_createrequire_filename)\nmodules, the `require()` function is not defined.\nThe `zx` provides `require()` function, so it can be used with imports in `.mjs`\nfiles (when using `zx` executable).\n\n```js\nlet {version} = require('./package.json')\n```\n\n## Experimental\n\nThe zx provides a few experimental functions. Please leave feedback about\nthose features in [the discussion](https://github.com/google/zx/discussions/299).\nTo enable new features via CLI pass `--experimental` flag.\n\n### `retry()`\n\nRetries a callback for a few times. Will return after the first\nsuccessful attempt, or will throw after specifies attempts count.\n\n```js\nimport { retry, expBackoff } from 'zx/experimental'\n\nlet p = await retry(10, () => $`curl https://medv.io`)\n\n// With a specified delay between attempts.\nlet p = await retry(20, '1s', () => $`curl https://medv.io`)\n\n// With an exponential backoff.\nlet p = await retry(30, expBackoff(), () => $`curl https://medv.io`)\n```\n\n### `spinner()`\n\nStarts a simple CLI spinner.\n\n```js\nimport { spinner } from 'zx/experimental'\n\nawait spinner(() => $`long-running command`)\n\n// With a message.\nawait spinner('working...', () => $`sleep 99`)\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Passing env variables\n\n```js\nprocess.env.FOO = 'bar'\nawait $`echo $FOO`\n```\n\n### Passing array of values\n\nWhen passing an array of values as an argument to `$`, items of the array will be escaped\nindividually and concatenated via space.\n\nExample:\n```js\nlet files = [...]\nawait $`tar cz ${files}`\n```\n\n### Importing into other scripts\n\nIt is possible to make use of `$` and other functions via explicit imports:\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nimport {$} from 'zx'\nawait $`date`\n```\n\n### Scripts without extensions\n\nIf script does not have a file extension (like `.git/hooks/pre-commit`), zx\nassumes that it is an [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_createrequire_filename)\nmodule.\n\n### Markdown scripts\n\nThe `zx` can execute [scripts written as markdown](docs/markdown.md):\n\n```bash\nzx docs/markdown.md\n```\n\n### TypeScript scripts\n\n```ts\nimport {$} from 'zx'\n// Or\nimport 'zx/globals'\n\nvoid async function () {\n  await $`ls -la`\n}()\n```\n\nSet [`\"type\": \"module\"`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_type)\nin **package.json** and [`\"module\": \"ESNext\"`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#module)\nin **tsconfig.json**.\n\n### Executing remote scripts\n\nIf the argument to the `zx` executable starts with `https://`, the file will be\ndownloaded and executed.\n\n```bash\nzx https://medv.io/game-of-life.js\n```\n\n### Executing scripts from stdin\n\nThe `zx` supports executing scripts from stdin.\n\n```js\nzx <<'EOF'\nawait $`pwd`\nEOF\n```\n\n### Executing scripts via --eval\n\nEvaluate the following argument as a script.\n\n```bash\ncat package.json | zx --eval 'let v = JSON.parse(await stdin()).version; echo(v)'\n```\n\n### Installing dependencies via --install\n\n```js\n// script.mjs:\nimport sh from 'tinysh'\nsh.say('Hello, world!')\n```\n\nAdd `--install` flag to the `zx` command to install missing dependencies \nautomatically.\n\n```bash\nzx --install script.mjs\n```\n\nYou can also specify needed version by adding comment with `@` after \nthe import.\n\n```js\nimport sh from 'tinysh' // @^1\n```\n\n### Attaching a profile\n\nBy default `child_process` does not include aliases and bash functions.\nBut you are still able to do it by hand. Just attach necessary directives \nto the `$.prefix`.\n\n```js\n$.prefix += 'export NVM_DIR=$HOME/.nvm; source $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh; '\nawait $`nvm -v`\n```\n\n### Using GitHub Actions\n\nThe default GitHub Action runner comes with `npx` installed.\n\n```yaml\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Build\n      env:\n        FORCE_COLOR: 3\n      run: |\n        npx zx <<'EOF'\n        await $`...`\n        EOF\n```\n\n### Canary / Beta / RC builds\nImpatient early adopters can try the experimental zx versions. But keep in mind: these builds are ⚠️️ __unstable__ in every sense.\n```bash\nnpm i zx@dev\nnpx zx@dev --install --quiet <<< 'import _ from \"lodash\" /* 4.17.15 */; console.log(_.VERSION)'\n```\n\n## License\n\n[Apache-2.0](LICENSE)\n\nDisclaimer: _This is not an officially supported Google product._\n",
