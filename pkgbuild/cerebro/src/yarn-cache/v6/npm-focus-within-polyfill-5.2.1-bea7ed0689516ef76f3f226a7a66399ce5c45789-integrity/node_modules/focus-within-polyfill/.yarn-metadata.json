In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the :focus pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by `:focus` (This includes descendants in shadow trees).\n\nThis selector is useful, to take a common example, for highlighting an entire `<form>` container when the user focuses on one of its `<input>` fields.\n\nMore information on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within).\n\n## ‚úèÔ∏è How to use\n\nThis package is available both as production ready script and as a package. The script can be downloaded [here](https://unpkg.com/focus-within-polyfill/dist/focus-within-polyfill.js), or installed with a package manager.\n\n```sh\n# npm\nnpm install focus-within-polyfill --save\n\n# yarn\nyarn add focus-within-polyfill\n```\n\nWhen included the polyfill will auto-initialize.\n\n```javascript\n/* ES5 */\n<script src='https://unpkg.com/focus-within-polyfill/dist/focus-within-polyfill.js'></script>\n```\n\nIn addition this library is available as a es6 module that can be imported and bundled up with any build tool. If you are importing it as a dependency, make sure to call the polyfill method:\n\n```javascript\n/* ES6 */\nimport 'focus-within-polyfill'\n```\n\nAfter import and initialization the polyfill will kick in **only** if `:focus-within` is not supported in the current browser. By default the `.focus-within` class will be added automatically to every element that should have the pseudo-class. Additionally in the initialization fase a `.js-focus-within` class will be appended to the body.\n\n## üìÉ How it works\n\nThis package will add two event listeners, one on the *focus* event and one on the *blur* event to trigger the automatic apply and remove of a custom attribute to indicate wheter the Element should have a `:focus-within` pseudo-class. In order to do so and be compatible with older version of IE and EDGE the `getAttribute`, `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute` methods are used to set both attributes and classes. Then `requestAnimationFrame` is used to apply the modification to the DOM.\n\nThis polyfill is compatible with native [Shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom#what) and with the [webcomponents polyfill](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills/). This means that even on IE11 and EDGE you will be able to use the `:focus-within` pseudo-class to style elements even outside a shadowRoot.\n\n## ‚≠ï Features\n\n* _Custom attribute/class_ value to apply the polyfill\n* _Shady CSS/DOM_ support even with the [webcomponents polyfill](https://www.webcomponents.org/polyfills/)\n* _Non standard Element_ support, like SVG Element with link inside\n\n## ‚úîÔ∏è Browser Support\n\n| Polyfill        | Edge | IE11+ | Chrome | Firefox | Safari |\n| --------------- |:----:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|\n| `:focus-within` | ‚úì    | ‚úì     | ‚úì      | ‚úì       | ‚úì      |\n\n\\* This polyfill maybe work on older versions of the browsers.\n\n## üì∫ Demos\n\nThe [demos](https://github.com/matteobad/focus-within-polyfill/tree/master/demos) folder contains 10+ demos that uses this polyfill.\n\n| Type      | Title                                                | Code                                | Live demo                                                                           |\n| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<button>` elements                | [Code](demos/buttons.html)          | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/buttons.html)        |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<input type=\"radio\">` elements    | [Code](demos/radios.html)           | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/radios.html)         |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<input type=\"checkbox\">` elements | [Code](demos/checkboxes.html)       | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/checkboxes.html)     |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<div contenteditable>` elements   | [Code](demos/editable-text.html)    | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/editable-text.html)  |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<div tabindex>` elements          | [Code](demos/focusable-divs.html)   | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/focusable-divs.html) |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<select>` elements                | [Code](demos/select.html)           | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/select.html)         |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<svg>` elements                   | [Code](demos/svg.html)              | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/svg.html)            |\n| Content   | :focus-within for `<web-components>` elements        | [Code](demos/web-components.html)   | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/web-components.html) |\n| Content   | :focus-within for other elements                     | [Code](demos/others.html)           | [Live](https://matteobad.github.io/focus-within-polyfill/demos/others.html)         |\n"
