The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reason.\n```\n\nThe following commit and commit `667ecc1` do not appear in the changelog if they are under the same release. If not, the revert commit appears under the \"Reverts\" header.\n\n```\nrevert: feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option\n\nThis reverts commit 667ecc1654a317a13331b17617d973392f415f02.\n```\n\n### Commit Message Format\n\nA commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**.  The header has a **type**, **scope** and **subject**:\n\n```\n<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<body>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nThe **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.\n\n### Revert\n\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.\n\n### Type\n\nIf the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However if there is any [BREAKING CHANGE](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.\n\nOther prefixes are up to your discretion. Suggested prefixes are `build`, `ci`, `docs` ,`style`, `refactor`, and `test` for non-changelog related tasks.\n\nDetails regarding these types can be found in the official [Angular Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).\n\n### Scope\n\nThe scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `$location`,\n`$browser`, `$compile`, `$rootScope`, `ngHref`, `ngClick`, `ngView`, etc...\n\n### Subject\n\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\n* use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\n* don't capitalize first letter\n* no dot (.) at the end\n\n### Body\n\nJust as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\n\n### Footer\n\nThe footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to\nreference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.\n\n**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\n\nA detailed explanation can be found in this [document](#commit-message-format).\n\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/conventional-changelog-angular.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/conventional-changelog-angular\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular\n[daviddm-image]: https://david-dm.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular.svg?theme=shields.io\n[daviddm-url]: https://david-dm.org/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular\n[coveralls-image]: https://coveralls.io/repos/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/badge.svg\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular\n[commit-message-format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#\n",
