    "readme": "# @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio\n\nA plugin that provides a composable API for giving elements a fixed aspect ratio.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the plugin from npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -D @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio\n```\n\nThen add the plugin to your `tailwind.config.js` file, and disable the `aspectRatio` core plugin to avoid conflicts with the native `aspect-ratio` utilities included in Tailwind CSS v3.0:\n\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    // ...\n  },\n  corePlugins: {\n    aspectRatio: false,\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio'),\n    // ...\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nCombine the `aspect-w-{n}` and `aspect-h-{n}` classes to specify the aspect ratio for an element:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n```\n\nUse `aspect-none` to remove any aspect ratio behavior:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 lg:aspect-none\">\n  <!-- ... -->\n</div>\n```\n\nWhen removing aspect ratio behavior, if nested elements have `w-{n}` or `h-{n}` classes, ensure they are re-declared with a matching breakpoint prefix:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 lg:aspect-none\">\n  <img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\" class=\"w-full h-full object-center object-cover lg:w-full lg:h-full\" />\n</div>\n```\n\nNote that due to the way this currently needs to be implemented ([the old padding-bottom trick](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/)) you need to assign the aspect ratio to a _parent_ element, and make the actual element you are trying to size the only child of that parent.\n\nOnce the [`aspect-ratio` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) is supported in modern browsers, we'll add official support to Tailwind CSS itself and deprecate this plugin.\n\nAspect ratio classes up to 16 are generated by default:\n\n| Width | Height |\n| --- | --- |\n| `aspect-w-1` | `aspect-h-1` |\n| `aspect-w-2` | `aspect-h-2` |\n| `aspect-w-3` | `aspect-h-3` |\n| `aspect-w-4` | `aspect-h-4` |\n| `aspect-w-5` | `aspect-h-5` |\n| `aspect-w-6` | `aspect-h-6` |\n| `aspect-w-7` | `aspect-h-7` |\n| `aspect-w-8` | `aspect-h-8` |\n| `aspect-w-9` | `aspect-h-9` |\n| `aspect-w-10` | `aspect-h-10` |\n| `aspect-w-11` | `aspect-h-11` |\n| `aspect-w-12` | `aspect-h-12` |\n| `aspect-w-13` | `aspect-h-13` |\n| `aspect-w-14` | `aspect-h-14` |\n| `aspect-w-15` | `aspect-h-15` |\n| `aspect-w-16` | `aspect-h-16` |\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can configure which values and variants are generated by this plugin under the `aspectRatio` key in your `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```js\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    aspectRatio: {\n      1: '1',\n      2: '2',\n      3: '3',\n      4: '4',\n    }\n  },\n  variants: {\n    aspectRatio: ['responsive', 'hover']\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Compatibility with default aspect-ratio utilities\n\nTailwind CSS v3.0 shipped with [native aspect-ratio](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) support, and while these new utilities are great, the `aspect-ratio` property isn't supported in Safari 14, which still has [significant global usage](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_aspect-ratio). If you need to support Safari 14, this plugin is still the best way to do that.\n\nWhile it's technically possible to use the new native `aspect-ratio` utilities as well as this plugin in the same project, it doesn't really make a lot of sense to do so. If you're able to use the new native aspect-ratio utilities, just use them instead of this plugin, as they are a lot simpler and work much better.\n\nHowever, if you do want to use both approaches in your project, maybe as a way of transitioning slowly from the plugin approach to the new native utilities, you'll need to add the following values to your `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  theme: {\n    aspectRatio: {\n      auto: 'auto',\n      square: '1 / 1',\n      video: '16 / 9',\n      1: '1',\n      2: '2',\n      3: '3',\n      4: '4',\n      5: '5',\n      6: '6',\n      7: '7',\n      8: '8',\n      9: '9',\n      10: '10',\n      11: '11',\n      12: '12',\n      13: '13',\n      14: '14',\n      15: '15',\n      16: '16',\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis is necessary, as the default `aspectRatio` values are overwritten by this plugin's values.\n",
