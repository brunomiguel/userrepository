This is a rewrite of [Reactive-Extensions/RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and is the latest production-ready version of RxJS. This rewrite is meant to have better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.\n\n[Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE.txt)\n\n- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Maintainer Guidelines](doc_app/content/maintainer-guidelines.md)\n- [API Documentation](https://rxjs.dev/)\n\n## Versions In This Repository\n\n- [master](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/commits/master) - This is all of the current, unreleased work, which is against v6 of RxJS right now\n- [stable](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/commits/stable) - This is the branch for the latest version you'd get if you do `npm install rxjs`\n\n## Important\n\nBy contributing or commenting on issues in this repository, whether you've read them or not, you're agreeing to the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Much like traffic laws, ignorance doesn't grant you immunity.\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\n### ES6 via npm\n\n```sh\nnpm install rxjs\n```\n\nIt's recommended to pull in the Observable creation methods you need directly from `'rxjs'` as shown below with `range`. And you can pull in any operator you need from one spot, under `'rxjs/operators'`.\n\n```ts\nimport { range } from \"rxjs\";\nimport { map, filter } from \"rxjs/operators\";\n\nrange(1, 200)\n  .pipe(\n    filter(x => x % 2 === 1),\n    map(x => x + x)\n  )\n  .subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n```\n\nHere, we're using the built-in `pipe` method on Observables to combine operators. See [pipeable operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/pipeable-operators.md) for more information.\n\n### CommonJS via npm\n\nTo install this library for CommonJS (CJS) usage, use the following command:\n\n```sh\nnpm install rxjs\n```\n\n(Note: destructuring available in Node 8+)\n\n```js\nconst { range } = require('rxjs');\nconst { map, filter } = require('rxjs/operators');\n\nrange(1, 200).pipe(\n  filter(x => x % 2 === 1),\n  map(x => x + x)\n).subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n```\n\n### CDN\n\nFor CDN, you can use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/):\n\nhttps://unpkg.com/rxjs/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js\n\nThe global namespace for rxjs is `rxjs`:\n\n```js\nconst { range } = rxjs;\nconst { map, filter } = rxjs.operators;\n\nrange(1, 200)\n  .pipe(\n    filter(x => x % 2 === 1),\n    map(x => x + x)\n  )\n  .subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n```\n\n## Goals\n\n- Smaller overall bundles sizes\n- Provide better performance than preceding versions of RxJS\n- To model/follow the [Observable Spec Proposal](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-observable) to the observable\n- Provide more modular file structure in a variety of formats\n- Provide more debuggable call stacks than preceding versions of RxJS\n\n## Building/Testing\n\n- `npm run build_all` - builds everything\n- `npm test` - runs tests\n- `npm run test_no_cache` - run test with `ts-node` set to false\n\n## Performance Tests\n\nRun `npm run build_perf` or `npm run perf` to run the performance tests with `protractor`.\n\nRun `npm run perf_micro [operator]` to run micro performance test benchmarking operator.\n\n## Adding documentation\n\nWe appreciate all contributions to the documentation of any type. All of the information needed to get the docs app up and running locally as well as how to contribute can be found in the [documentation directory](./docs_app).\n\n## Generating PNG marble diagrams\n\nThe script `npm run tests2png` requires some native packages installed locally: `imagemagick`, `graphicsmagick`, and `ghostscript`.\n\nFor Mac OS X with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):\n\n- `brew install imagemagick`\n- `brew install graphicsmagick`\n- `brew install ghostscript`\n- You may need to install the Ghostscript fonts manually:\n  - Download the tarball from the [gs-fonts project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gs-fonts)\n  - `mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ghostscript && tar zxvf /path/to/ghostscript-fonts.tar.gz -C /usr/local/share/ghostscript`\n\nFor Debian Linux:\n\n- `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dhor/myway`\n- `apt-get install imagemagick`\n- `apt-get install graphicsmagick`\n- `apt-get install ghostscript`\n\nFor Windows and other Operating Systems, check the download instructions here:\n\n- http://imagemagick.org\n- http://www.graphicsmagick.org\n- http://www.ghostscript.com/\n",
