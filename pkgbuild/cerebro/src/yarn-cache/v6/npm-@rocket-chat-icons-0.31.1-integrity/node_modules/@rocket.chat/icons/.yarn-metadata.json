As Figma can export graphics with some additional SVG attributes and elements, they must be\nremoved:\n\n- The `<svg>` element must contain only two attributes: `viewBox` (probably with the value of`\"0 0 32 32\"`) and\n  `xmlns`;\n- XLink references (e.g. masks and clip paths) must be discarded;\n- The `<path>` elements must keep only the `d` attribute, with no additional styling attribute;\n- `<g>` and other elements must be stripped by some optimization tooling, keeping only `<path>` elements.\n\nThe `src/` directory holds all the SVG icons that would be processed. The filenames define the icon names, so they\nshould stick with a basic rule: **an icon name must describe the icon shape, not its utility**. For instance:\n\n- [-] `message.svg` (wrong)\n- [x] `balloon.svg` (right)\n\nIf the icon must be mirrored for right-to-left read direction, it required to add a trailing `.dir` before the file\nextension (e.g. `backspace.dir.svg`).\n\n### Building\n\nAs this package dependends on others in this monorepo, before anything run the following at the root directory:\n\n<!--yarn(build)-->\n\n```sh\nyarn build\n```\n\n<!--/yarn(build)-->\n\nAfter building, make sure to run at the root:\n\n```sh\nyarn\n\nyarn update-storybook\n```\n\n### Linting\n\nTo ensure the source is matching our coding style, we perform [linting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>).\nBefore commiting, check if your code fits our style by running:\n\n<!--yarn(lint)-->\n\n```sh\nyarn lint\n```\n\n<!--/yarn(lint)-->\n\nSome linter warnings and errors can be automatically fixed:\n\n<!--yarn(lint-and-fix)-->\n\n```sh\nyarn lint-and-fix\n```\n\n<!--/yarn(lint-and-fix)-->\n",
