It'll do that for you.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst deferToConnect = require('defer-to-connect');\n\ndeferToConnect(socket, () => {\n    console.log('Connected!');\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### deferToConnect(socket, connectListener)\n\nCalls `connectListener()` when connected.\n\n### deferToConnect(socket, listeners)\n\n#### listeners\n\nAn object representing `connect`, `secureConnect` and `close` properties.\n\nCalls `connect()` when the socket is connected.<br>\nCalls `secureConnect()` when the socket is securely connected.<br>\nCalls `close()` when the socket is destroyed.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
