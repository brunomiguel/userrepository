If you only need to check synchronously, this module is not needed.\n\nWhile [`fs.exists()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback) is being [deprecated](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/103), there's still a genuine use-case of being able to check if a path exists for other purposes than doing IO with it.\n\nNever use this before handling a file though:\n\n> In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to `fs.exists()` and `fs.open()`. Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install path-exists\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\n// foo.js\nconst pathExists = require('path-exists');\n\n(async () => {\n\tconsole.log(await pathExists('foo.js'));\n\t//=> true\n})();\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### pathExists(path)\n\nReturns a `Promise<boolean>` of whether the path exists.\n\n### pathExists.sync(path)\n\nReturns a `boolean` of whether the path exists.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [path-exists-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/path-exists-cli) - CLI for this module\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n",
