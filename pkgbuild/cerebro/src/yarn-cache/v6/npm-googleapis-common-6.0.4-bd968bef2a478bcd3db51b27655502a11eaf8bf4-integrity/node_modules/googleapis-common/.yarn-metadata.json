You probably don't want to use this directly.\n\n\nA comprehensive list of changes in each version may be found in\n[the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-googleapis-common/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n* [Google APIs Common Module Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs]\n\n* [github.com/googleapis/nodejs-googleapis-common](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-googleapis-common)\n\nRead more about the client libraries for Cloud APIs, including the older\nGoogle APIs Client Libraries, in [Client Libraries Explained][explained].\n\n[explained]: https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained\n\n**Table of contents:**\n\n\n* [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n\n  * [Installing the client library](#installing-the-client-library)\n\n\n* [Versioning](#versioning)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [License](#license)\n\n## Quickstart\n\n### Installing the client library\n\n```bash\nnpm install googleapis-common\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nThe [Google APIs Common Module Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation\nalso contains samples.\n\n## Supported Node.js Versions\n\nOur client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).\nLibraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of\nNode.js.\nIf you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update\nas soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.\n\nGoogle's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a\nbest-efforts basis with the following warnings:\n\n* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.\n* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.\n* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.\n\nClient libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and\ncan be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).\nThe dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.\nFor example, `npm install googleapis-common@legacy-8` installs client libraries\nfor versions compatible with Node.js 8.\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\n\n\n\nThis library is considered to be **stable**. The code surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways\nunless absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with\nan extensive deprecation period. Issues and requests against **stable** libraries\nare addressed with the highest priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information: [Google Cloud Platform Launch Stages][launch_stages]\n\n[launch_stages]: https://cloud.google.com/terms/launch-stages\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions welcome!
