    "readme": "# is-interactive [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/is-interactive.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/is-interactive)\n\n> Check if stdout or stderr is [interactive](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/43389/7678)\n\nIt checks that the stream is [TTY](https://jameshfisher.com/2017/12/09/what-is-a-tty/), not a dumb terminal, and not running in a CI.\n\nThis can be useful to decide whether to present interactive UI or animations in the terminal.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install is-interactive\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst isInteractive = require('is-interactive');\n\nisInteractive();\n//=> true\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### isInteractive(options?)\n\n#### options\n\nType: `object`\n\n##### stream\n\nType: [`stream.Writable`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable)<br>\nDefault: [`process.stdout`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stdout)\n\nThe stream to check.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Why are you not using [`ci-info`](https://github.com/watson/ci-info) for the CI check?\n\nIt's silly to have to detect individual CIs. They should identify themselves with the `CI` environment variable, and most do just that. A manually maintained list of detections will easily get out of date. And if a package using `ci-info` doesn't update to the latest version all the time, they will not support certain CIs. It also creates unpredictability as you might assume a CI is not supported and then suddenly it gets supported and you didn't account for that. In addition, some of the manual detections are loose and might cause false-positives which could create hard-to-debug bugs.\n\n#### Why does this even exist? It's just a few lines.\n\nIt's not about the number of lines, but rather discoverability and documentation. A lot of people wouldn't even know they need this. Feel free to copy-paste the code if you don't want the dependency. You might also want to read [this blog post](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/small-focused-modules-9238d977a92a).\n",
