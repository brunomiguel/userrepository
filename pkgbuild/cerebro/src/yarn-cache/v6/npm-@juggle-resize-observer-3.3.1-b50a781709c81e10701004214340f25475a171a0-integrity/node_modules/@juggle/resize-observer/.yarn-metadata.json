Check out the [Example Playground](//juggle.studio/resize-observer) for more information on usage and performance.\n\n> The latest [Resize Observer specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/resize-observer-1/) is not yet finalised and is subject to change.\n> Any drastic changes to the specification will bump the major version of this library, as there will likely be breaking changes. Check the [release notes](https://github.com/juggle/resize-observer/releases) for more information.\n\n\n## Installation\n``` shell\nnpm i @juggle/resize-observer\n```\n\n## Basic usage\n``` js\nimport { ResizeObserver } from '@juggle/resize-observer';\n\nconst ro = new ResizeObserver((entries, observer) => {\n  console.log('Body has resized!');\n  observer.disconnect(); // Stop observing\n});\n\nro.observe(document.body); // Watch dimension changes on body\n```\nThis will use the [ponyfilled](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill) version of **ResizeObserver**, even if the browser supports **ResizeObserver** natively.\n\n## Watching multiple elements\n``` js\nimport { ResizeObserver } from '@juggle/resize-observer';\n\nconst ro = new ResizeObserver((entries, observer) => {\n  console.log('Elements resized:', entries.length);\n  entries.forEach((entry, index) => {\n    const { inlineSize: width, blockSize: height } = entry.contentBoxSize[0];\n    console.log(`Element ${index + 1}:`, `${width}x${height}`);\n  });\n});\n\nconst els = document.querySelectorAll('.resizes');\n[...els].forEach(el => ro.observe(el)); // Watch multiple!\n```\n\n## Watching different box sizes\n\nThe latest standards allow for watching different box sizes. The box size option can be specified when observing an element. Options include `border-box`, `device-pixel-content-box` and `content-box` (default).\n``` js\nimport { ResizeObserver } from '@juggle/resize-observer';\n\nconst ro = new ResizeObserver((entries, observer) => {\n  console.log('Elements resized:', entries.length);\n  entries.forEach((entry, index) => {\n    const [size] = entry.borderBoxSize;\n    console.log(`Element ${index + 1}:`, `${size.inlineSize}x${size.blockSize}`);\n  });\n});\n\n// Watch border-box\nconst observerOptions = {\n  box: 'border-box'\n};\n\nconst els = document.querySelectorAll('.resizes');\n[...els].forEach(el => ro.observe(el, observerOptions));\n```\n*From the spec:*\n> The box size properties are exposed as sequences in order to support elements that have multiple fragments, which occur in [multi-column](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#) scenarios. However the current definitions of content rect and border box do not mention how those boxes are affected by multi-column layout. In this spec, there will only be a single ResizeObserverSize returned in the sequences, which will correspond to the dimensions of the first column. A future version of this spec will extend the returned sequences to contain the per-fragment size information.\n\n## Using the legacy version (`contentRect`)\n\nEarly versions of the API return a `contentRect`. This is still made available for backwards compatibility.\n\n``` js\nimport { ResizeObserver } from '@juggle/resize-observer';\n\nconst ro = new ResizeObserver((entries, observer) => {\n  console.log('Elements resized:', entries.length);\n  entries.forEach((entry, index) => {\n    const { width, height } = entry.contentRect;\n    console.log(`Element ${index + 1}:`, `${width}x${height}`);\n  });\n});\n\nconst els = document.querySelectorAll('.resizes');\n[...els].forEach(el => ro.observe(el));\n```\n\n\n## Switching between native and polyfilled versions\n\nYou can check to see if the native version is available and switch between this and the polyfill to improve performance on browsers with native support.\n\n``` js\nimport { ResizeObserver as Polyfill } from '@juggle/resize-observer';\n\nconst ResizeObserver = window.ResizeObserver || Polyfill;\n\n// Uses native or polyfill, depending on browser support.\nconst ro = new ResizeObserver((entries, observer) => {\n  console.log('Something has resized!');\n});\n```\n\nTo improve this even more, you could use dynamic imports to only load the file when the polyfill is required.\n\n``` js\n(async () => {\n  if ('ResizeObserver' in window === false) {\n    // Loads polyfill asynchronously, only if required.\n    const module = await import('@juggle/resize-observer');\n    window.ResizeObserver = module.ResizeObserver;\n  }\n  // Uses native or polyfill, depending on browser support.\n  const ro = new ResizeObserver((entries, observer) => {\n    console.log('Something has resized!');\n  });\n})();\n```\n\n> Browsers with native support may be behind on the latest specification.\n> Use `entry.contentRect` when switching between native and polyfilled versions.\n\n\n## Resize loop detection\n\nResize Observers have inbuilt protection against infinite resize loops.\n\nIf an element's observed box size changes again within the same resize loop, the observation will be skipped and an error event will be dispatched on the window. Elements with undelivered notifications will be considered for delivery in the next loop.\n\n```js\nimport { ResizeObserver } from '@juggle/resize-observer';\n\nconst ro = new ResizeObserver((entries, observer) => {\n  // Changing the body size inside of the observer\n  // will cause a resize loop and the next observation will be skipped\n  document.body.style.width = '50%';\n});\n\n// Listen for errors\nwindow.addEventListener('error', e => console.log(e.message));\n\n// Observe the body\nro.observe(document.body);\n```\n\n## Notification Schedule\nNotifications are scheduled after all other changes have occurred and all other animation callbacks have been called. This allows the observer callback to get the most accurate size of an element, as no other changes should occur in the same frame.\n\n![resize observer notification schedule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1519516/52825568-20433500-30b5-11e9-9854-4cee13a09a7d.jpg)\n\n\n\n## How are differences detected?\n\nTo prevent constant polling, every frame. The DOM is queried whenever an event occurs which could cause an element to change its size. This could be when an element is clicked, a DOM Node is added, or, when an animation is running.\n\nTo cover these scenarios, there are two types of observation. The first is to listen to specific DOM events, including `resize`, `mousedown` and `focus` to name a few. The second is to listen for any DOM mutations that occur. This detects when a DOM node is added or removed, an attribute is modified, or, even when some text has changed.\n\nThis allows for greater idle time, when the application itself is idle.\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Inbuilt resize loop protection.\n- Supports pseudo classes `:hover`, `:active` and `:focus`.\n- Supports transitions and animations, including infinite and long-running.\n- Detects changes which occur during animation frame.\n- Includes support for latest draft spec - observing different box sizes.\n- Polls only when required, then shuts down automatically, reducing CPU usage.\n- Zero delay system - Notifications are batched and delivered immediately, before the next paint.\n\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Transitions with initial delays cannot be detected.*\n- Animations and transitions with long periods of no change, will not be detected.*\n- Style changes from dev tools will only be noticed if they are inline styles.*\n\n\n## Tested Browsers\n\n[chrome]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/chrome/chrome_64x64.png\n[safari]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/safari/safari_64x64.png\n[safari-ios]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/safari-ios/safari-ios_64x64.png\n[ff]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/firefox/firefox_64x64.png\n[opera]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/opera/opera_64x64.png\n[opera-mini]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/opera-mini/opera-mini_64x64.png\n[edge_12-18]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/archive/edge_12-18/edge_12-18_64x64.png\n[edge]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/edge/edge_64x64.png\n[samsung]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/samsung-internet/samsung-internet_64x64.png\n[ie]: https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos/raw/master/src/archive/internet-explorer_9-11/internet-explorer_9-11_64x64.png\n\n### Desktop\n| ![chrome][chrome] | ![safari][safari] | ![ff][ff] | ![opera][opera] | ![edge][edge] | ![edge][edge_12-18] | ![IE][ie] |\n|--------|--------|---------|-------|------|------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Chrome | Safari | Firefox | Opera | Edge | Edge 12-18 | IE11<br/>IE 9-10 (with polyfills)\\*\\* |\n\n### Mobile\n| ![chrome][chrome] | ![safari][safari] | ![ff][ff] | ![opera][opera] | ![opera mini][opera-mini] | ![edge][edge_12-18] | ![samsung internet][samsung] |\n|--------|--------|---------|-------|------------|------|------------------|\n| Chrome | Safari | Firefox | Opera | Opera Mini | Edge | Samsung Internet |\n\n---\n\n\\*If other interaction occurs, changes will be detected.\n\n\\*\\*IE10 requires additional polyfills for `WeakMap`, `MutationObserver` and `devicePixelRatio`.
