TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript. Try it out at the [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/), and stay up to date via [our blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/typescript).\n\nFind others who are using TypeScript at [our community page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/community/).\n\n## Installing\n\nFor the latest stable version:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript\n```\n\nFor our nightly builds:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g typescript@next\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nThere are many ways to [contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to TypeScript.\n* [Submit bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.\n* Review the [source code changes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pulls).\n* Engage with other TypeScript users and developers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript).\n* Help each other in the [TypeScript Community Discord](https://discord.gg/typescript).\n* Join the [#typescript](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TypeScript) discussion on Twitter.\n* [Contribute bug fixes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n* Read the language specification ([docx](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.docx?raw=true),\n [pdf](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf?raw=true), [md](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md)).\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see\nthe [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com)\nwith any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Documentation\n\n*  [TypeScript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)\n*  [Programming handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)\n*  [Language specification](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/master/doc/spec.md)\n*  [Homepage](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n\n## Building\n\nIn order to build the TypeScript compiler, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.\n\nClone a copy of the repo:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript.git\n```\n\nChange to the TypeScript directory:\n\n```bash\ncd TypeScript\n```\n\nInstall [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) tools and dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g gulp\nnpm ci\n```\n\nUse one of the following to build and test:\n\n```\ngulp local             # Build the compiler into built/local.\ngulp clean             # Delete the built compiler.\ngulp LKG               # Replace the last known good with the built one.\n                       # Bootstrapping step to be executed when the built compiler reaches a stable state.\ngulp tests             # Build the test infrastructure using the built compiler.\ngulp runtests          # Run tests using the built compiler and test infrastructure.\n                       # Some low-value tests are skipped when not on a CI machine - you can use the\n                       # --skipPercent=0 command to override this behavior and run all tests locally.\n                       # You can override the specific suite runner used or specify a test for this command.\n                       # Use --tests=<testPath> for a specific test and/or --runner=<runnerName> for a specific suite.\n                       # Valid runners include conformance, compiler, fourslash, project, user, and docker\n                       # The user and docker runners are extended test suite runners - the user runner\n                       # works on disk in the tests/cases/user directory, while the docker runner works in containers.\n                       # You'll need to have the docker executable in your system path for the docker runner to work.\ngulp runtests-parallel # Like runtests, but split across multiple threads. Uses a number of threads equal to the system\n                       # core count by default. Use --workers=<number> to adjust this.\ngulp baseline-accept   # This replaces the baseline test results with the results obtained from gulp runtests.\ngulp lint              # Runs eslint on the TypeScript source.\ngulp help              # List the above commands.\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nnode built/local/tsc.js hello.ts\n```\n\n\n## Roadmap\n\nFor details on our planned features and future direction please refer to our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap).\n",
