For basic syntax, check out the [Mustache\nmanpage](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html).\n\nOnce you have a template, use the `Handlebars.compile` method to compile\nthe template into a function. The generated function takes a context\nargument, which will be used to render the template.\n\n```js\nvar source = \"<p>Hello, my name is {{name}}. I am from {{hometown}}. I have \" +\n             \"{{kids.length}} kids:</p>\" +\n             \"<ul>{{#kids}}<li>{{name}} is {{age}}</li>{{/kids}}</ul>\";\nvar template = Handlebars.compile(source);\n\nvar data = { \"name\": \"Alan\", \"hometown\": \"Somewhere, TX\",\n             \"kids\": [{\"name\": \"Jimmy\", \"age\": \"12\"}, {\"name\": \"Sally\", \"age\": \"4\"}]};\nvar result = template(data);\n\n// Would render:\n// <p>Hello, my name is Alan. I am from Somewhere, TX. I have 2 kids:</p>\n// <ul>\n//   <li>Jimmy is 12</li>\n//   <li>Sally is 4</li>\n// </ul>\n```\n\nFull documentation and more examples are at [handlebarsjs.com](https://handlebarsjs.com/).\n\nPrecompiling Templates\n----------------------\n\nHandlebars allows templates to be precompiled and included as javascript code rather than the handlebars template allowing for faster startup time. Full details are located [here](https://handlebarsjs.com/installation/precompilation.html).\n\nDifferences Between Handlebars.js and Mustache\n----------------------------------------------\nHandlebars.js adds a couple of additional features to make writing\ntemplates easier and also changes a tiny detail of how partials work.\n\n- [Nested Paths](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#path-expressions)\n- [Helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#helpers)\n- [Block Expressions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/block-helpers.html#basic-blocks)\n- [Literal Values](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#literal-segments)\n- [Delimited Comments](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#template-comments)\n\nBlock expressions have the same syntax as mustache sections but should not be confused with one another. Sections are akin to an implicit `each` or `with` statement depending on the input data and helpers are explicit pieces of code that are free to implement whatever behavior they like. The [mustache spec](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) defines the exact behavior of sections. In the case of name conflicts, helpers are given priority.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nThere are a few Mustache behaviors that Handlebars does not implement.\n- Handlebars deviates from Mustache slightly in that it does not perform recursive lookup by default. The compile time `compat` flag must be set to enable this functionality. Users should note that there is a performance cost for enabling this flag. The exact cost varies by template, but it's recommended that performance sensitive operations should avoid this mode and instead opt for explicit path references.\n- The optional Mustache-style lambdas are not supported. Instead Handlebars provides its own lambda resolution that follows the behaviors of helpers.\n- Alternative delimiters are not supported.\n\n\nSupported Environments\n----------------------\n\nHandlebars has been designed to work in any ECMAScript 3 environment. This includes\n\n- Node.js\n- Chrome\n- Firefox\n- Safari 5+\n- Opera 11+\n- IE 6+\n\nOlder versions and other runtimes are likely to work but have not been formally\ntested. The compiler requires `JSON.stringify` to be implemented natively or via a polyfill. If using the precompiler this is not necessary.\n\n[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/handlebars.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/handlebars)\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nIn a rough performance test, precompiled Handlebars.js templates (in\nthe original version of Handlebars.js) rendered in about half the\ntime of Mustache templates. It would be a shame if it were any other\nway, since they were precompiled, but the difference in architecture\ndoes have some big performance advantages. Justin Marney, a.k.a.\n[gotascii](http://github.com/gotascii), confirmed that with an\n[independent test](http://sorescode.com/2010/09/12/benchmarks.html). The\nrewritten Handlebars (current version) is faster than the old version,\nwith many [performance tests](https://travis-ci.org/wycats/handlebars.js/builds/33392182#L538) being 5 to 7 times faster than the Mustache equivalent.\n\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n\nSee [release-notes.md](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md) for upgrade notes.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nSee [FAQ.md](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/FAQ.md) for known issues and common pitfalls.\n\n\nHandlebars in the Wild\n----------------------\n\n* [Assemble](http://assemble.io), by [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert)\n  and [@doowb](https://github.com/doowb), is a static site generator that uses Handlebars.js\n  as its template engine.\n* [Cory](https://github.com/leo/cory), by [@leo](https://github.com/leo), is another tiny static site generator\n* [CoSchedule](http://coschedule.com) An editorial calendar for WordPress that uses Handlebars.js\n* [dashbars](https://github.com/pismute/dashbars) A modern helper library for Handlebars.js.\n* [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) makes Handlebars.js the primary way to\n  structure your views, also with automatic data binding support.\n* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) Just a blogging platform.\n* [handlebars_assets](http://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets): A Rails Asset Pipeline gem\n  from Les Hill (@leshill).\n* [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/assemble/handlebars-helpers) is an extensive library\n  with 100+ handlebars helpers.\n* [handlebars-layouts](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-layouts) is a set of helpers which implement extendible and embeddable layout blocks as seen in other popular templating languages.\n* [hbs](http://github.com/donpark/hbs): An Express.js view engine adapter for Handlebars.js,\n  from Don Park.\n* [koa-hbs](https://github.com/jwilm/koa-hbs): [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) generator based\n  renderer for Handlebars.js.\n* [jblotus](http://github.com/jblotus) created [http://tryhandlebarsjs.com](http://tryhandlebarsjs.com)\n  for anyone who would like to try out Handlebars.js in their browser.\n* [jQuery plugin](http://71104.github.io/jquery-handlebars/): allows you to use\n  Handlebars.js with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).\n* [Lumbar](http://walmartlabs.github.io/lumbar) provides easy module-based template management for\n  handlebars projects.\n* [Marionette.Handlebars](https://github.com/hashchange/marionette.handlebars) adds support for Handlebars and Mustache templates to Marionette.\n* [sammy.js](http://github.com/quirkey/sammy) by Aaron Quint, a.k.a. quirkey,\n  supports Handlebars.js as one of its template plugins.\n* [SproutCore](http://www.sproutcore.com) uses Handlebars.js as its main\n  templating engine, extending it with automatic data binding support.\n* [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/handlebars/) implements a port of handlebars\n* [Swag](https://github.com/elving/swag) by [@elving](https://github.com/elving) is a growing collection of helpers for handlebars.js.
