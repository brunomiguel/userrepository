    "readme": "# librespot-node\n\nThis project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).\n\n## Installing librespot-node\n\nInstalling librespot-node requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).\n\nYou can install the project with npm. In the project directory, run:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n```\n\nThis fully installs the project, including installing any dependencies and running the build.\n\n## Building librespot-node\n\nIf you have already installed the project and only want to run the build, run:\n\n```sh\n$ npm run build\n```\n\nThis command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust build and copy the built library into `./index.node`.\n\n## Exploring librespot-node\n\nAfter building librespot-node, you can explore its exports at the Node REPL:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n$ node\n> require('.').hello()\n\"hello node\"\n```\n\n## Available Scripts\n\nIn the project directory, you can run:\n\n### `npm install`\n\nInstalls the project, including running `npm run build`.\n\n### `npm build`\n\nBuilds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source.\n\nAdditional [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) arguments may be passed to `npm build` and `npm build-*` commands. For example, to enable a [cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):\n\n```\nnpm run build -- --feature=beetle\n```\n\n#### `npm build-debug`\n\nAlias for `npm build`.\n\n#### `npm build-release`\n\nSame as [`npm build`](#npm-build) but, builds the module with the [`release`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#release) profile. Release builds will compile slower, but run faster.\n\n### `npm test`\n\nRuns the unit tests by calling `cargo test`. You can learn more about [adding tests to your Rust code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).\n\n## Project Layout\n\nThe directory structure of this project is:\n\n```\nlibrespot-node/\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── README.md\n├── index.node\n├── package.json\n├── src/\n|   └── lib.rs\n└── target/\n```\n\n### Cargo.toml\n\nThe Cargo [manifest file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html), which informs the `cargo` command.\n\n### README.md\n\nThis file.\n\n### index.node\n\nThe Node addon—i.e., a binary Node module—generated by building the project. This is the main module for this package, as dictated by the `\"main\"` key in `package.json`.\n\nUnder the hood, a [Node addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) is a [dynamically-linked shared object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries). The `\"build\"` script produces this file by copying it from within the `target/` directory, which is where the Rust build produces the shared object.\n\n### package.json\n\nThe npm [manifest file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json), which informs the `npm` command.\n\n### src/\n\nThe directory tree containing the Rust source code for the project.\n\n### src/lib.rs\n\nThe Rust library's main module.\n\n### target/\n\nBinary artifacts generated by the Rust build.\n\n## Learn More\n\nTo learn more about Neon, see the [Neon documentation](https://neon-bindings.com).\n\nTo learn more about Rust, see the [Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org).\n\nTo learn more about Node, see the [Node documentation](https://nodejs.org).\n",
