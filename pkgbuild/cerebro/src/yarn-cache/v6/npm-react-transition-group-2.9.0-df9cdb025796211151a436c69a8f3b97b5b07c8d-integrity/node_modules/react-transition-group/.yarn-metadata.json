Documentation and code for that release are available on the [`v1-stable`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable) branch.**\n>\n> We are no longer updating the v1 codebase, please upgrade to v2 when possible\n\nA set of components for managing component states (including mounting and unmounting) over time, specifically designed with animation in mind.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [**Main documentation**](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)\n- [Migration guide from v1](/Migration.md)\n\n## Examples\n\nClone the repo first:\n\n```\ngit@github.com:reactjs/react-transition-group.git\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` (or `yarn`), and finally `npm run storybook` to start a storybook instance that you can navigate to in your browser to see the examples.\n\n[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-transition-group.svg\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-transition-group\n",
