<p align="center">Automatically bundle & compile <a href="https://github.com/andywer/threads.js">threads.js</a> workers within webpack.</p>

This plugin is a fork of [worker-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/worker-plugin): This is an adapted version of the original `worker-plugin` that supports `Worker` constructors imported from [`threads`](https://github.com/andywer/threads.js).

### Features

Automatically compiles modules loaded in Web Workers:

```js
const worker = new Worker('./foo.js', { type: 'module' });
                          ^^^^^^^^^^
                          gets bundled using webpack
```

The best part? That worker constructor works just fine without bundling turned on too.

Workers created from Blob & data URLs or without the `{ type:'module' }` option are left unchanged.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D threads-plugin
```

Then drop it into your **webpack.config.js:**

```diff
+ const ThreadsPlugin = require('threads-plugin');

module.exports = {
  <...>
  plugins: [
+    new ThreadsPlugin()
  ]
  <...>
}
```

## Usage

**worker.js**: _(our worker module)_

```js
// This is a module worker, so we can use imports (in the browser too!)
import { expose } from 'threads';
import { calculatePi } from './some-other-module';

expose(function piTimesTwo(precision) {
  return calculatePi(precision) * 2
})
```

**main.js**: _(our demo, on the main thread)_

```js
import { spawn, Worker } from 'threads';

main().catch(console.error)

async function main() {
  const piTimesTwo = await spawn(new Worker('./worker.js'))
  console.log(`pi x 2 = ${await piTimesTwo(42)}`)
}
```

**Please make sure to use the `Worker` imported from `threads`, not the global `Worker`! The plugin will only consider those imported `Worker` instantiations.**

## Babel / TypeScript

When transpiling your source code using Babel or TypeScript, make sure to that ES modules are transpiled by webpack, not by Babel or TypeScript. Otherwise the threads plugin won't be able to identify the imports.

### Babel

In your Babel configuration when using `@babel/preset-env`:

```
"presets": [
  ["env", {
    "modules": false
  }]
]
```

If you are using `create-react-app` or `babel-preset-react-app` (`"presets": ["react-app"]`), you are already good to go - no need to adapt the configuration.

So the idea is to make sure that ES modules are still intact and not transpiled down to anything else by Babel. Otherwise the plugin won't work. This kind of configuration is best practice anyhow.

### TypeScript

When using TypeScript, make sure this setting is part of your TypeScript configuration, either in the `ts-loader` options or in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```
"compilerOptions": {
  "module": "esnext"
}
```

## Electron

To use standard Node packages in Electron web workers, make sure Node integration in workers is [turned on](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/multithreading)
and the plugin option [target](#target) is set to `electron-node-worker`.

## Options

In most cases, no options are necessary to use WorkerPlugin.

### `globalObject`

ThreadsPlugin will warn you if your Webpack configuration has `output.globalObject` set to `window`, since doing so breaks Hot Module Replacement in web workers.

If you're not using HMR and want to disable this warning, pass `globalObject:false`:

```js
new ThreadsPlugin({
  // disable warnings about "window" breaking HMR:
  globalObject: false
})
```

To configure the value of `output.globalObject` for ThreadsPlugin's internal Webpack Compiler, set `globalObject` to any String:

```js
new ThreadsPlugin({
  // use "self" as the global object when receiving hot updates.
  globalObject: 'self' // <-- this is the default value
})
```

### `plugins`

By default, `ThreadsPlugin` doesn't run any of your configured Webpack plugins when bundling worker code - this avoids running things like `html-webpack-plugin` twice. For cases where it's necessary to apply a plugin to Worker code, use the `plugins` option.

Here you can specify the names of plugins to "copy" from your existing Webpack configuration, or provide specific plugins to apply only to worker code:

```js
module.exports = {
  <...>
  plugins: [
    // an example of a plugin already being used:
    new SomeExistingPlugin({ <...> }),

    new ThreadsPlugin({
      plugins: [
        // A string here will copy the named plugin from your configuration:
        'SomeExistingPlugin',

        // Or you can specify a plugin directly, only applied to Worker code:
        new SomePluginToApplyOnlyToWorkers({ <...> })
      ]
    })
  ]
  <...>
}
```

### `target` 

Due to the way webpack works, it may be necessary to change the target environment of the workers. Using this option you can override webpack's [`target` option](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target/#root) just for the worker bundle. Defaults to the global webpack `target`.

Frequently used values:

- `electron-node-worker`: use this if you are using Electron and compiling web workers that have node integration enabled. See [Electron Multithreading](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/multithreading).

Example with electron node workers:
```js
new ThreadsPlugin({
  target: 'electron-node-worker'
})
```
