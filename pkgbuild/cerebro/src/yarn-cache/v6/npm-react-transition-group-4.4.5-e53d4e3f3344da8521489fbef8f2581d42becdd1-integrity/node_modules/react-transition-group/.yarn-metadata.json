Documentation and code for that release are available on the [`v1-stable`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable) branch.**\n>\n> We are no longer updating the v1 codebase, please upgrade to the latest version when possible\n\nA set of components for managing component states (including mounting and unmounting) over time, specifically designed with animation in mind.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [**Main documentation**](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)\n- [Migration guide from v1](/Migration.md)\n\n## TypeScript\nTypeScript definitions are published via [**DefinitelyTyped**](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) and can be installed via the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @types/react-transition-group\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nClone the repo first:\n\n```\ngit@github.com:reactjs/react-transition-group.git\n```\n\nThen run `npm install` (or `yarn`), and finally `npm run storybook` to start a storybook instance that you can navigate to in your browser to see the examples.\n\n[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-transition-group.svg\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-transition-group\n",
