No new changes are expected to land. In fact, none have landed for some time. This package is also deprecated because it depends on `request`.\n\nFyi, here is the [reasoning of `request`'s deprecation](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142) and a [list of alternative libraries](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3143).\n\n---\n\nThis package is similar to [`request-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) but uses native ES6+ promises.\n\nPlease refer to the [`request-promise` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise). Everything applies to `request-promise-native` except the following:\n- Instead of using Bluebird promises this library uses native ES6+ promises.\n- Native ES6+ promises may have fewer features than Bluebird promises do. In particular, the `.finally(...)` method was not included until Node v10.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis module is installed via npm:\n\n```\nnpm install --save request\nnpm install --save request-promise-native\n```\n\n`request` is defined as a peer-dependency and thus has to be installed separately.\n\n## Migration from `request-promise` to `request-promise-native`\n\n1. Go through the [migration instructions](https://github.com/request/request-promise#migration-from-v3-to-v4) to upgrade to `request-promise` v4.\n2. Ensure that you don't use Bluebird-specific features on the promise returned by your request calls. In particular, you can't use `.finally(...)` anymore.\n3. You are done.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo set up your development environment:\n\n1. clone the repo to your desktop,\n2. in the shell `cd` to the main folder,\n3. hit `npm install`,\n4. hit `npm install gulp -g` if you haven't installed gulp globally yet, and\n5. run `gulp dev`. (Or run `node ./node_modules/.bin/gulp dev` if you don't want to install gulp globally.)\n\n`gulp dev` watches all source files and if you save some changes it will lint the code and execute all tests. The test coverage report can be viewed from `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.\n\nIf you want to debug a test you should use `gulp test-without-coverage` to run all tests without obscuring the code by the test coverage instrumentation.\n\n## Change History\n\n- v1.0.9 (2020-07-21)\n    - Security fix: bumped `request-promise-core` which bumps `lodash` to `^4.17.19` following [this advisory](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1523).\n- v1.0.8 (2019-11-03)\n    - Security fix: bumped `request-promise-core` which bumps `lodash` to `^4.17.15`. See [vulnerabilty reports](https://snyk.io/vuln/search?q=lodash&type=npm).\n      *(Thanks to @aw-davidson for reporting this in issue [#49](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native/issues/49).)*\n- v1.0.7 (2019-02-14)\n    - Corrected mistakenly set `tough-cookie` version, now `^2.3.3`\n      *(Thanks to @evocateur for pointing this out.)*\n    - If you installed `request-promise-native@1.0.6` please make sure after the upgrade that `request` and `request-promise-native` use the same physical copy of `tough-cookie`.\n- v1.0.6 (2019-02-14)\n    - Using stricter `tough-cookie@~2.3.3` to avoid installing `tough-cookie@3` which introduces breaking changes\n      *(Thanks to @jasonmit for pull request [#33](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native/pull/33/))*\n    - Security fix: bumped `lodash` to `^4.17.11`, see [vulnerabilty reports](https://snyk.io/vuln/search?q=lodash&type=npm)\n- v1.0.5 (2017-09-22)\n    - Upgraded `tough-cookie` to a version without regex DoS vulnerability\n      *(Thanks to @sophieklm for [pull request #13](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native/pull/13))*\n- v1.0.4 (2017-05-07)\n    - Fix that allows to use `tough-cookie` for [cookie creation](https://github.com/request/request-promise#include-a-cookie)\n- v1.0.3 (2016-08-08)\n    - Renamed internally used package `@request/promise-core` to `request-promise-core` because there where [too](https://github.com/request/request-promise/issues/137) [many](https://github.com/request/request-promise/issues/141) issues with the scoped package name\n- v1.0.2 (2016-07-18)\n    - Fix for using with module bundlers like Webpack and Browserify\n- v1.0.1 (2016-07-17)\n    - Fixed `@request/promise-core` version for safer versioning\n- v1.0.0 (2016-07-15)\n    - Initial version similar to [`request-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise) v4\n\n## License (ISC)\n\nIn case you never heard about the [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) it is functionally equivalent to the MIT license.\n\nSee the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for details.\n",
