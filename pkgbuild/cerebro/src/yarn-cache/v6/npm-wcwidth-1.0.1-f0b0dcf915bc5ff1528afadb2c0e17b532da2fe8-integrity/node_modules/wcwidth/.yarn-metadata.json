POSIX.1-2001, and return the number of columns used\nto represent the given wide character and string.\n\nMarkus's implementation assumes the wide character given to those\nfunctions to be encoded in ISO 10646, which is almost true for\nJavaScript's characters.\n\n[Further explaination here](docs)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
