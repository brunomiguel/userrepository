That's fine but it's hard to keep\non track of different outputs. Also if one process fails, others still keep running\nand you won't even notice the difference.\n\nAnother option would be to just run all commands in separate terminals. I got\ntired of opening terminals and made **concurrently**.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Cross platform (including Windows)\n- Output is easy to follow with prefixes\n- With `--kill-others` switch, all commands are killed if one dies\n- Spawns commands with [spawn-command](https://github.com/mmalecki/spawn-command)\n\n## Install\n\nThe tool is written in Node.js, but you can use it to run **any** commands.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g concurrently\n```\n\nor if you are using it from npm scripts:\n\n```bash\nnpm install concurrently --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n> **Note**\n> The `concurrently` command is now also available under the shorthand alias `conc`.\n\nRemember to surround separate commands with quotes:\n\n```bash\nconcurrently \"command1 arg\" \"command2 arg\"\n```\n\nOtherwise **concurrently** would try to run 4 separate commands:\n`command1`, `arg`, `command2`, `arg`.\n\nIn package.json, escape quotes:\n\n```bash\n\"start\": \"concurrently \\\"command1 arg\\\" \\\"command2 arg\\\"\"\n```\n\nNPM run commands can be shortened:\n\n```bash\nconcurrently \"npm:watch-js\" \"npm:watch-css\" \"npm:watch-node\"\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n watch-js,watch-css,watch-node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n```\n\nNPM shortened commands also support wildcards. Given the following scripts in\npackage.json:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  //...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    // ...\n    \"watch-js\": \"...\",\n    \"watch-css\": \"...\",\n    \"watch-node\": \"...\"\n    // ...\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```bash\nconcurrently \"npm:watch-*\"\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n js,css,node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n\n# Any name provided for the wildcard command will be used as a prefix to the wildcard\n# part of the script name:\nconcurrently -n w: npm:watch-*\n\n# Equivalent to:\nconcurrently -n w:js,w:css,w:node \"npm run watch-js\" \"npm run watch-css\" \"npm run watch-node\"\n```\n\nExclusion is also supported. Given the following scripts in package.json:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  // ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint:js\": \"...\",\n    \"lint:ts\": \"...\",\n    \"lint:fix:js\": \"...\",\n    \"lint:fix:ts\": \"...\"\n    // ...\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```bash\n# Running only lint:js and lint:ts\n#   with lint:fix:js and lint:fix:ts excluded\nconcurrently \"npm:lint:*(!fix)\"\n```\n\nGood frontend one-liner example [here](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/dont-copy-paste-this-frontend-template/blob/5cd2bde719654941bdfc0a42c6f1b8e69ae79980/package.json#L9).\n\nHelp:\n\n```\nconcurrently [options] <command ...>\n\nGeneral\n  -m, --max-processes          How many processes should run at once.\n                               New processes only spawn after all restart tries\n                               of a process.

Can be overriden per command.\n    Default: `process.cwd()`.\n  - `defaultInputTarget`: the default input target when reading from `inputStream`.\n    Default: `0`.\n  - `handleInput`: when `true`, reads input from `process.stdin`.\n  - `inputStream`: a [`Readable` stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams)\n    to read the input from. Should only be used in the rare instance you would like to stream anything other than `process.stdin`. Overrides `handleInput`.\n  - `pauseInputStreamOnFinish`: by default, pauses the input stream (`process.stdin` when `handleInput` is enabled, or `inputStream` if provided) when all of the processes have finished. If you need to read from the input stream after `concurrently` has finished, set this to `false`. ([#252](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently/issues/252)).\n  - `killOthers`: an array of exitting conditions that will cause a process to kill others.\n    Can contain any of `success` or `failure`.\n  - `maxProcesses`: how many processes should run at once.\n  - `outputStream`: a [`Writable` stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/stream.html#stream_writable_streams)\n    to write logs to. Default: `process.stdout`.\n  - `prefix`: the prefix type to use when logging processes output.\n    Possible values: `index`, `pid`, `time`, `command`, `name`, `none`, or a template (eg `[{time} process: {pid}]`).\n    Default: the name of the process, or its index if no name is set.\n  - `prefixColors`: a list of colors as supported by [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) or `auto` for an automatically picked color.\n    If concurrently would run more commands than there are colors, the last color is repeated, unless if the last color value is `auto` which means following colors are automatically picked to vary.\n    Prefix colors specified per-command take precedence over this list.\n  - `prefixLength`: how many characters to show when prefixing with `command`. Default: `10`\n  - `raw`: whether raw mode should be used, meaning strictly process output will\n    be logged, without any prefixes, coloring or extra stuff.\n  - `successCondition`: the condition to consider the run was successful.\n    If `first`, only the first process to exit will make up the success of the run; if `last`, the last process that exits will determine whether the run succeeds.\n    Anything else means all processes should exit successfully.\n  - `restartTries`: how many attempts to restart a process that dies will be made. Default: `0`.\n  - `restartDelay`: how many milliseconds to wait between process restarts. Default: `0`.\n  - `timestampFormat`: a [date-fns format](https://date-fns.org/v2.0.1/docs/format)\n    to use when prefixing with `time`. Default: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.ZZZ`\n  - `additionalArguments`: list of additional arguments passed that will get replaced in each command. If not defined, no argument replacing will happen.\n\n> **Returns:** an object in the shape `{ result, commands }`.\n>\n> - `result`: a `Promise` that resolves if the run was successful (according to `successCondition` option),\n>   or rejects, containing an array of [`CloseEvent`](#CloseEvent), in the order that the commands terminated.\n> - `commands`: an array of all spawned [`Command`s](#Command).\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst concurrently = require('concurrently');\nconst { result } = concurrently(\n  [\n    'npm:watch-*',\n    { command: 'nodemon', name: 'server' },\n    { command: 'deploy', name: 'deploy', env: { PUBLIC_KEY: '...' } },\n    {\n      command: 'watch',\n      name: 'watch',\n      cwd: path.resolve(__dirname, 'scripts/watchers'),\n    },\n  ],\n  {\n    prefix: 'name',\n    killOthers: ['failure', 'success'],\n    restartTries: 3,\n    cwd: path.resolve(__dirname, 'scripts'),\n  }\n);\nresult.then(success, failure);\n```\n\n### `Command`\n\nAn object that contains all information about a spawned command, and ways to interact with it.<br>\nIt has the following properties:\n\n- `index`: the index of the command among all commands spawned.\n- `command`: the command line of the command.\n- `name`: the name of the command; defaults to an empty string.\n- `cwd`: the current working directory of the command.\n- `env`: an object with all the environment variables that the command will be spawned with.\n- `killed`: whether the command has been killed.\n- `exited`: whether the command exited yet.\n- `pid`: the command's process ID.\n- `stdin`: a Writable stream to the command's `stdin`.\n- `stdout`: an RxJS observable to the command's `stdout`.\n- `stderr`: an RxJS observable to the command's `stderr`.\n- `error`: an RxJS observable to the command's error events (e.g. when it fails to spawn).\n- `timer`: an RxJS observable to the command's timing events (e.g. starting, stopping).\n- `close`: an RxJS observable to the command's close events.\n  See [`CloseEvent`](#CloseEvent) for more information.\n- `start()`: starts the command, setting up all\n- `kill([signal])`: kills the command, optionally specifying a signal (e.g. `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, etc).\n\n### `CloseEvent`\n\nAn object with information about a command's closing event.<br>\nIt contains the following properties:\n\n- `command`: a stripped down version of [`Command`](#command), including only `name`, `command`, `env` and `cwd` properties.\n- `index`: the index of the command among all commands spawned.\n- `killed`: whether the command exited because it was killed.\n- `exitCode`: the exit code of the command's process, or the signal which it was killed with.\n- `timings`: an object in the shape `{ startDate, endDate, durationSeconds }`.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Process exited with code _null_?\n\n  From [Node child_process documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_exit), `exit` event:\n\n  > This event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process\n  > terminated normally, code is the final exit code of the process,\n  > otherwise null. If the process terminated due to receipt of a signal,\n  > signal is the string name of the signal, otherwise null.\n\n  So _null_ means the process didn't terminate normally. This will make **concurrently**\n  to return non-zero exit code too.\n\n- Does this work with the npm-replacements [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)?\n\n  Yes! In all examples above, you may replace \"`npm`\" with \"`yarn`\" or \"`pnpm`\".\n",
