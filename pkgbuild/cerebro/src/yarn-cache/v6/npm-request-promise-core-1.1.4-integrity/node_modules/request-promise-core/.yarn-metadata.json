It is only recommended to use this library directly, if you have very specific requirements.\n\n## Installation for `request@^2.34`\n\nThis module is installed via npm:\n\n```\nnpm install --save request\nnpm install --save request-promise-core\n```\n\n`request` is defined as a peer-dependency and thus has to be installed separately.\n\n## Usage for `request@^2.34`\n\n``` js\n// 1. Load the request library\n\n// Only use a direct require if you are 100% sure that:\n// - Your project does not use request directly. That is without the Promise capabilities by calling require('request').\n// - Any of the installed libraries use request.\n// ...because Request's prototype will be patched in step 2.\n/* var request = require('request'); */\n\n// Instead use:\nvar stealthyRequire = require('stealthy-require');\nvar request = stealthyRequire(require.cache, function () {\n    return require('request');\n});\n\n\n// 2. Add Promise support to request\n\nvar configure = require('request-promise-core/configure/request2');\n\nconfigure({\n    request: request,\n\t// Pass your favorite ES6-compatible promise implementation\n    PromiseImpl: Promise,\n\t// Expose all methods of the promise instance you want to call on the request(...) call\n    expose: [\n        'then',   // Allows to use request(...).then(...)\n        'catch',  // Allows to use request(...).catch(...)\n        'promise' // Allows to use request(...).promise() which returns the promise instance\n    ],\n    // Optional: Pass a callback that is called within the Promise constructor\n    constructorMixin: function (resolve, reject) {\n        // `this` is the request object\n        // Additional arguments may be passed depending on the PromiseImpl used\n    }\n});\n\n\n// 3. Use request with its promise capabilities\n\n// E.g. crawl a web page:\nrequest('http://www.google.com')\n    .then(function (htmlString) {\n        // Process html...\n    })\n    .catch(function (err) {\n        // Crawling failed...\n    });\n```\n\n## Installation and Usage for `request@next`\n\n[Request Next](https://github.com/request/request/issues/1982) is still in alpha. However, `request-promise-core` is already designed to be compatible and ships with a configuration helper – `require('request-promise-core/configure/request-next')` – that is [used by `request-promise`](https://github.com/request/request-promise/blob/next/lib/rp.js) in its \"next\" branch.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo set up your development environment:\n\n1. clone the repo to your desktop,\n2. in the shell `cd` to the main folder,\n3. hit `npm install`,\n4. hit `npm install gulp -g` if you haven't installed gulp globally yet, and\n5. run `gulp dev`. (Or run `node ./node_modules/.bin/gulp dev` if you don't want to install gulp globally.)\n\n`gulp dev` watches all source files and if you save some changes it will lint the code and execute all tests. The test coverage report can be viewed from `./coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.\n\nIf you want to debug a test you should use `gulp test-without-coverage` to run all tests without obscuring the code by the test coverage instrumentation.\n\n## Change History\n\n- 1.1.4 (2020-07-21)\n    - Security fix: bumped `lodash` to `^4.17.19` following [this advisory](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1523).\n- 1.1.3 (2019-11-03)\n    - Security fix: bumped `lodash` to `^4.17.15`. See [vulnerabilty reports](https://snyk.io/vuln/search?q=lodash&type=npm).\n      *(Thanks to @daniel-nagy for pull request [#20](https://github.com/request/promise-core/pull/20) and thanks to @quetzaluz for reporting this in issue [#21](https://github.com/request/promise-core/issues/21).)*\n- 1.1.2 (2019-02-14)\n    - Security fix: bumped `lodash` to `^4.17.11`. See [vulnerabilty reports](https://snyk.io/vuln/search?q=lodash&type=npm).\n      *(Thanks to @lucaswillering and @sam-warren-finnair for reporting this in issues [#12](https://github.com/request/promise-core/issues/12) and [#13](https://github.com/request/promise-core/issues/13) and thanks to @Alec321 for pull request [#14](https://github.com/request/promise-core/pull/14).)*\n- 1.1.1 (2016-08-08)\n    - Renamed package to `request-promise-core` because there were [too](https://github.com/request/request-promise/issues/137) [many](https://github.com/request/request-promise/issues/141) issues with the scoped package name `@request/promise-core`\n- 1.1.0 (2016-07-30)\n    - Added `constructorMixin` option to enable [request/request-promise#123](https://github.com/request/request-promise/pull/123)\n- 1.0.0 (2016-07-15)\n    - All tests green, ready for prime time\n- 1.0.0-rc.1 (2016-07-10)\n    - Reimplementation of core logic based on `request-promise@3.0.0`\n    - Plus `transform2xxOnly` option (fixes [request/request-promise#131](https://github.com/request/request-promise/issues/131))\n\n## License (ISC)\n\nIn case you never heard about the [ISC license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license) it is functionally equivalent to the MIT license.\n\nSee the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for details.\n",
