No soup for you!'\n);\n//  'This thing should be true but you set to false. No soup for you!'\n```\n\nSimilar to Facebook's (FB) invariant but only logs a warning if the condition is not met.\nThis can be used to log issues in development environments in critical\npaths. Removing the logging code for production environments will keep the\nsame logic and follow the same code paths.\n\n## FAQ (READ before opening an issue)\n\n> Why do you use `console.error` instead of `console.warn` ?\n\nThis is a mirror of Facebook's (FB) [warning](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/__forks__/warning.js) module used within React's source code (and other FB software).\nAs such this module will mirror their code as much as possible. \n\nThe descision to use `error` over `warn` was made a long time ago by the FB team and isn't going to change anytime soon.\n\nThe source can be found here: https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/__forks__/warning.js\nThe reasoning can be found here and elsewhere: https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/94#issuecomment-168332326\n\n> Can I add X feature?\n\nThis is a mirror of Facebook's (FB) [warning](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/blob/master/packages/fbjs/src/__forks__/warning.js) and as such the source and signature will mirror that module.\n\nIf you believe a feature is missing than please open a feature request [there](https://github.com/facebook/fbjs).\nIf it is approved and merged in that this module will be updated to reflect that change, otherwise this module will not change.\n\n## Use in Production\n\nIt is recommended to add [babel-plugin-dev-expression](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/babel-plugin-dev-expression) with this module to remove warning messages in production.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<small>Don't Forget To Be Awesome</small>\n",
