Don’t worry, this script is only 537 bytes.\n\n## Usage\n\n- First, transform `prefers-color-scheme` queries using this\n  [PostCSS plugin](README-POSTCSS.md).\n- Next, apply light and dark color schemes everywhere using this\n  [browser script](README-BROWSER.md).\n\n---\n\n## How does it work?\n\n[Prefers Color Scheme] uses a [PostCSS plugin](README-POSTCSS.md) to transform\n`prefers-color-scheme` queries into `color-index` queries. This changes\n`prefers-color-scheme: dark` into `(color-index: 48)`,\n`prefers-color-scheme: light` into `(color-index: 70)`, and\n`prefers-color-scheme: no-preference` into `(color-index: 22)`.\n\nThe frontend receives these `color-index` queries, which are understood in all\nmajor browsers going back to Internet Explorer 9. However, since browsers only\napply `color-index` queries of `0`, our color scheme values are ignored.\n\n[Prefers Color Scheme] uses a [browser script](README-BROWSER.md) to change\n`(color-index: 48)` queries into `not all and (color-index: 48)` in order to\nactivate “dark mode” specific CSS, and it changes `(color-index: 70)` queries\ninto `not all and (color-index: 48)` to activate “light mode” specific CSS.\n\n```css\n@media (color-index: 70) { /* prefers-color-scheme: light */\n  body {\n    background-color: white;\n    color: black;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince these media queries are accessible to `document.styleSheet`, no CSS\nparsing is required.\n\n## Why does the fallback work this way?\n\nThe value of `48` is chosen for dark mode because it is the keycode for `0`,\nthe hexidecimal value of black. Likewise, `70` is chosen for light mode because\nit is the keycode for `f`, the hexidecimal value of white.\n\n[cli-img]: https://img.shields.io/travis/csstools/css-prefers-color-scheme.svg\n[cli-url]: https://travis-ci.org/csstools/css-prefers-color-scheme\n[git-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/support-chat-blue.svg\n[git-url]: https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss\n[npm-img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/css-prefers-color-scheme.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-prefers-color-scheme\n\n[PostCSS]: https://github.com/postcss/postcss\n[Prefers Color Scheme]: https://github.com/csstools/css-prefers-color-scheme\n[Media Queries]: https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme\n",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4.
