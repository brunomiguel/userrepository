The available options are `throw`, `warn`, and `ignore`. The\ndefault option is to `throw`.\n\nIf `ignore` is used, the `color-mod()` function will remain unchanged.\n\n```js\nimport postcssColorMod from 'postcss-color-mod-function';\n\npostcssColorMod({\n  unresolved: 'ignore' // ignore unresolved color-mod() functions\n});\n```\n\n### transformVars\n\nThe `transformVars` option defines whether `var()` variables used within\n`color-mod()` should be transformed into their corresponding Custom Properties\navailable in `:root`, or their fallback value if it is specified. By default,\n`var()` variables will be transformed.\n\nHowever, because these transformations occur at build time, they cannot be\nconsidered accurate. Accurately resolving cascading variables relies on\nknowledge of the living DOM tree.\n\n### importFrom\n\nThe `importFrom` option allows you to import variables from other sources,\nwhich might be CSS, JS, and JSON files, and directly passed objects.\n\n```js\npostcssColorMod({\n  importFrom: 'path/to/file.css' // :root { --brand-dark: blue; --brand-main: var(--brand-dark); }\n});\n```\n\n```pcss\n.brand-faded {\n  color: color-mod(var(--brand-main) a(50%));\n}\n\n/* becomes */\n\n.brand-faded {\n  color: rgba(0, 0, 255, .5);\n}\n```\n\nMultiple files can be passed into this option, and they will be parsed in the\norder they were received. JavaScript files, JSON files, and objects will need\nto namespace custom properties under a `customProperties` or\n`custom-properties` key.\n\n```js\npostcssColorMod({\n  importFrom: [\n    'path/to/file.css',   // :root { --brand-dark: blue; --brand-main: var(--brand-dark); }\n    'and/then/this.js',   // module.exports = { customProperties: { '--brand-dark': 'blue', '--brand-main': 'var(--brand-dark)' } }\n    'and/then/that.json', // { \"custom-properties\": { \"--brand-dark\": \"blue\", \"--brand-main\": \"var(--brand-dark)\" } }\n    {\n      customProperties: {\n        '--brand-dark': 'blue',\n        '--brand-main': 'var(--brand-dark)'\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nVariables may reference other variables, and this plugin will attempt to\nresolve them. If `transformVars` is set to `false` then `importFrom` will not\nbe used.\n\n[cli-img]: https://img.shields.io/travis/jonathantneal/postcss-color-mod-function.svg\n[cli-url]: https://travis-ci.org/jonathantneal/postcss-color-mod-function\n[css-img]: https://cssdb.org/badge/color-mod-function.svg\n[css-url]: https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#color-mod-function\n[git-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/support-chat-blue.svg\n[git-url]: https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss\n[npm-img]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/postcss-color-mod-function.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-color-mod-function\n\n[CSS Color Module Level 4]: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#funcdef-color-mod\n[Gulp PostCSS]: https://github.com/postcss/gulp-postcss\n[Grunt PostCSS]: https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-postcss\n[PostCSS]: https://github.com/postcss/postcss\n[PostCSS color-mod() Function]: https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-color-mod-function\n",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”).

The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.

Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4.
