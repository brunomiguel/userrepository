It also provides integrations for Browser and Node that provide a good experience out of the box.\n\n## Migrating from @sentry/apm to @sentry/tracing\n\nThe tracing integration for JavaScript SDKs has moved from\n[`@sentry/apm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/apm) to\n[`@sentry/tracing`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/tracing). While the\ntwo packages are similar, some imports and APIs have changed slightly.\n\nThe old package `@sentry/apm` is deprecated in favor of `@sentry/tracing`.\nFuture support for `@sentry/apm` is limited to bug fixes only.\n\n## Migrating from @sentry/apm to @sentry/tracing\n\n### Browser (CDN bundle)\n\nIf you were using the Browser CDN bundle, switch from the old\n`bundle.apm.min.js` to the new tracing bundle:\n\n```html\n<script\n  src=\"https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.min.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}\"\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n></script>\n```\n\nAnd then update `Sentry.init`:\n\n```diff\n Sentry.init({\n-  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Tracing()]\n+  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()]\n });\n```\n\n### Browser (npm package)\n\nIf you were using automatic instrumentation, update the import statement and\nupdate `Sentry.init` to use the new `BrowserTracing` integration:\n\n```diff\n import * as Sentry from \"@sentry/browser\";\n-import { Integrations } from \"@sentry/apm\";\n+import { Integrations } from \"@sentry/tracing\";\n\n Sentry.init({\n   integrations: [\n-    new Integrations.Tracing(),\n+    new Integrations.BrowserTracing(),\n   ]\n });\n```\n\nIf you were using the `beforeNavigate` option from the `Tracing` integration,\nthe API in `BrowserTracing` has changed slightly. Instead of passing in a\nlocation and returning a string representing transaction name, `beforeNavigate`\nnow accepts a transaction context and is expected to return a transaction\ncontext. You can now add extra tags or change the `op` based on different\nparameters. If you want to access the location like before, you can get it from\n`window.location`.\n\nFor example, if you had a function like so that computed a custom transaction\nname:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as Sentry from \"@sentry/browser\";\nimport { Integrations } from \"@sentry/apm\";\n\nSentry.init({\n  integrations: [\n    new Integrations.Tracing({\n      beforeNavigate: location => {\n        return getTransactionName(location);\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nYou would now leverage the context to do the same thing:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as Sentry from \"@sentry/browser\";\nimport { Integrations } from \"@sentry/tracing\";\n\nSentry.init({\n  integrations: [\n    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({\n      beforeNavigate: context => {\n        return {\n          ...context,\n          // Can even look at context tags or other data to adjust\n          // transaction name\n          name: getTransactionName(window.location),\n        };\n      },\n    }),\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nFor the full diff:\n\n```diff\n import * as Sentry from \"@sentry/browser\";\n-import { Integrations } from \"@sentry/apm\";\n+import { Integrations } from \"@sentry/tracing\";\n\n Sentry.init({\n   integrations: [\n-    new Integrations.Tracing({\n-      beforeNavigate: (location) => {\n-        return getTransactionName(location)\n+    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({\n+      beforeNavigate: (ctx) => {\n+        return {\n+          ...ctx,\n+          name: getTransactionName(ctx.name, window.location)\n+        }\n       }\n     }),\n   ]\n });\n```\n\n### Node\n\nIf you were using the Express integration for automatic instrumentation, the\nonly necessary change is to update the import statement:\n\n```diff\n import * as Sentry from \"@sentry/node\";\n-import { Integrations } from \"@sentry/apm\";\n+import { Integrations } from \"@sentry/tracing\";\n\n Sentry.init({\n   integrations: [\n     new Integrations.Express(),\n   ]\n });\n```\n",
