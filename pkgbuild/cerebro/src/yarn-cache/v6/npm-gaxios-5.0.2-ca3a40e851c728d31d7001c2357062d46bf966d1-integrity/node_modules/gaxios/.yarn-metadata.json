This is often useful when making many requests to the same domain with the same base settings.  For example:\n\n```js\nconst gaxios = require('gaxios');\ngaxios.instance.defaults = {\n  baseURL: 'https://example.com'\n  headers: {\n    Authorization: 'SOME_TOKEN'\n  }\n}\ngaxios.request({url: '/data'}).then(...);\n```\n\nNote that setting default values will take precedence\nover other authentication methods, i.e., application default credentials.\n\n## Request Options\n\n```js\n{\n  // The url to which the request should be sent.  Required.\n  url: string,\n\n  // The HTTP method to use for the request.  Defaults to `GET`.\n  method: 'GET',\n\n  // The base Url to use for the request. Prepended to the `url` property above.\n  baseURL: 'https://example.com';\n\n  // The HTTP methods to be sent with the request.\n  headers: { 'some': 'header' },\n\n  // The data to send in the body of the request. Data objects will be\n  // serialized as JSON.\n  //\n  // Note: if you would like to provide a Content-Type header other than\n  // application/json you you must provide a string or readable stream, rather\n  // than an object:\n  // data: JSON.stringify({some: 'data'})\n  // data: fs.readFile('./some-data.jpeg')\n  data: {\n    some: 'data'\n  },\n\n  // The max size of the http response content in bytes allowed.\n  // Defaults to `0`, which is the same as unset.\n  maxContentLength: 2000,\n\n  // The max number of HTTP redirects to follow.\n  // Defaults to 100.\n  maxRedirects: 100,\n\n  // The querystring parameters that will be encoded using `qs` and\n  // appended to the url\n  params: {\n    querystring: 'parameters'\n  },\n\n  // By default, we use the `querystring` package in node core to serialize\n  // querystring parameters.  You can override that and provide your\n  // own implementation.\n  paramsSerializer: (params) => {\n    return qs.stringify(params);\n  },\n\n  // The timeout for the HTTP request. Defaults to 0.\n  timeout: 1000,\n\n  // Optional method to override making the actual HTTP request. Useful\n  // for writing tests and instrumentation\n  adapter?: async (options, defaultAdapter) => {\n    const res = await defaultAdapter(options);\n    res.data = {\n      ...res.data,\n      extraProperty: 'your extra property',\n    };\n    return res;\n  };\n\n  // The expected return type of the request.  Options are:\n  // json | stream | blob | arraybuffer | text\n  // Defaults to `json`.\n  responseType: 'json',\n\n  // The node.js http agent to use for the request.\n  agent: someHttpsAgent,\n\n  // Custom function to determine if the response is valid based on the\n  // status code.  Defaults to (>= 200 && < 300)\n  validateStatus: (status: number) => true,\n\n  // Implementation of `fetch` to use when making the API call. By default,\n  // will use the browser context if available, and fall back to `node-fetch`\n  // in node.js otherwise.\n  fetchImplementation?: typeof fetch;\n\n  // Configuration for retrying of requests.\n  retryConfig: {\n    // The number of times to retry the request.  Defaults to 3.\n    retry?: number;\n\n    // The number of retries already attempted.\n    currentRetryAttempt?: number;\n\n    // The HTTP Methods that will be automatically retried.\n    // Defaults to ['GET','PUT','HEAD','OPTIONS','DELETE']\n    httpMethodsToRetry?: string[];\n\n    // The HTTP response status codes that will automatically be retried.\n    // Defaults to: [[100, 199], [429, 429], [500, 599]]\n    statusCodesToRetry?: number[][];\n\n    // Function to invoke when a retry attempt is made.\n    onRetryAttempt?: (err: GaxiosError) => Promise<void> | void;\n\n    // Function to invoke which determines if you should retry\n    shouldRetry?: (err: GaxiosError) => Promise<boolean> | boolean;\n\n    // When there is no response, the number of retries to attempt. Defaults to 2.\n    noResponseRetries?: number;\n\n    // The amount of time to initially delay the retry, in ms.  Defaults to 100ms.\n    retryDelay?: number;\n  },\n\n  // Enables default configuration for retries.\n  retry: boolean,\n\n  // Cancelling a request requires the `abort-controller` library.\n  // See https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch#request-cancellation-with-abortsignal\n  signal?: AbortSignal\n}\n```\n\n## License\n[Apache-2.0](https://github.com/googleapis/gaxios/blob/master/LICENSE)\n",
