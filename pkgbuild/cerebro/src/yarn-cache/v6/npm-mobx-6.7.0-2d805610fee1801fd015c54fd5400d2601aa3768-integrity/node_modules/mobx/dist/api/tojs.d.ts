/**
 * Recursively converts an observable to it's non-observable native counterpart.
 * It does NOT recurse into non-observables, these are left as they are, even if they contain observables.
 * Computed and other non-enumerable properties are completely ignored.
 * Complex scenarios require custom solution, eg implementing `toJSON` or using `serializr` lib.
