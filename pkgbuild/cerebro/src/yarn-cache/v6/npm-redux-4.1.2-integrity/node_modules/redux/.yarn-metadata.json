On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.  \nIt is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).\n\n> **Note**: We are currently planning a rewrite of the Redux docs. Please take some time to **[fill out this survey on what content is most important in a docs site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzIkY3fXZ8PrQKScYMK0YoEgALfAK2qQ0mOj1_ibKv2qDTuQ/viewform)**.

Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - come join us!\n\n## Before Proceeding Further\n\nRedux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Don't use Redux just because someone said you should - take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nDan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.\n\n## Influences\n\nRedux evolves the ideas of [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/), but avoids its complexity by taking cues from [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/).  \nEven if you haven't used Flux or Elm, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the stable version:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save redux\n```\n\nThis assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.\n\nIf you're not, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/redux/), download them, or point your package manager to them.\n\nMost commonly, people consume Redux as a collection of [CommonJS](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/commonjs) modules. These modules are what you get when you import `redux` in a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), we support that as well.\n\nIf you don't use a module bundler, it's also fine. The `redux` npm package includes precompiled production and development [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the [`dist` folder](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/). They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a [`<script>` tag](https://unpkg.com/redux/dist/redux.js) on the page, or [tell Bower to install it](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/pull/1181#issuecomment-167361975). The UMD builds make Redux available as a `window.Redux` global variable.\n\nThe Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in [any modern browser](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5). You don't need to use Babel or a module bundler to [get started with Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/examples/counter-vanilla/index.html). You can even use the ES module build that's available at [`es/redux.mjs`](https://unpkg.com/redux/es/) which can be referenced using `type=\"module\"` in your `script` tag or as a standard `import`.\n\n### Complementary Packages\n\nMost likely, you'll also need [the React bindings](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) and [the developer tools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save react-redux\nnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools\n```\n\nNote that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don't provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) for the most comfortable development experience.\n\n## The Gist\n\nThe whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.  \nThe only way to change the state tree is to emit an _action_, an object describing what happened.  \nTo specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure _reducers_.\n\nThat's it!\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.\n * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.\n *\n * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,\n * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should\n * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.\n *\n * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that\n * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your\n * project.\n */\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\n// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.\n// Its API is { subscribe, dispatch, getState }.\nlet store = createStore(counter)\n\n// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.\n// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.\n// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.\n\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.\n// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 1\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n// 2\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' })\n// 1\n```\n\nInstead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called _actions_. Then you write a special function called a _reducer_ to decide how every action transforms the entire application's state.\n\nIf you're coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn't have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components.\n\nThis architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action.\n\n## Learn Redux from Its Authors\n\n### Redux Video Tutorials by Dan Abramov\n\n#### Getting Started with Redux\n\n**[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)** is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), author of Redux.
